In January 1984 the Minister of Justice, Frank Leeflang, replied to an Amnesty International letter of December 1983 which expressed concem at the reported incommunicado detention and ill-treatment of 14 people held in military custody. Up to 90 people had been arrested in November 1983 foUowing an alleged coup attempt and Amnesty International had asked the Minister for their names and places of detention. It had urged that they be promptly charged and brought before a court or released, and that they be granted access to relatives and lawyers. Amnesty Intemational's concem was increased by previous reports of the torture and summary execution of a number of people held incommunicado in military custody following alleged coup attempts in 1982 (see Amnesty Intemational Report 1983 and 1984).
In his reply the Minister confirmed that some of the 14 people named by Amnesty Intemational were among those arrested in November 1983, but denied that as many as 90 people had been detained He stated that seven of the detainees had since been transferred into civilian custody, and that two of these had been released after appearing in court He said that those still in detention were being humanely treated and, "so far as the investigation permits", had been allowed access to lawyers and relatives. Five of the detainees were tried in a civilian court in June on charges of attempted arson or complicity in arson. One was acquitted and the others received sentences of between one and three years' imprisonment
