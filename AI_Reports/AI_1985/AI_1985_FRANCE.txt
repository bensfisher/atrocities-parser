Amnesty Intemational continued to be concemed about the prosecution and imprisonment of conscientious objectors who had refused to conform to the national service laws.
The number of newly imprisoned conscientious objectors declined in 1984, largely because of the application of Law 83-605, which modified the Code of National Service. It came into effect on 8 July 1983. The law allowed greater flexibility in granting conscientious objector status and improved the type of altemative civilian service objectors were allowed to perform. The duration of altemative service remained 24 months, however, double that of military service. Amnesty Intemational believed this to be punitive and continued to work for the release of conscientious objectors who had refused both military and civilian service, whose refusal to perform civilian service was based on their objection to its duration, not to the principle of performing civilian service.
Amnesty Intemational worked on behalf of 10 conscientious objectors, many of whom had begun their prison sentences in 1983.
On 17 May France became a party to the Optional Protocol to the Intemational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, thereby allowing individuals to submit complaints to the Human Rights Committee set up under the Covenant
