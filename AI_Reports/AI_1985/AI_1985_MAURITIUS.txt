Mauritius
The first execution in more than 23 years was carried out on 23 November when Louis Leopold Myrtile was hanged at Beau Bassin prison. He had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death in April 1982 by the Court of Assizes. His sentence was confirmed by the Appeal Court in July 1982, after which Amnesty Intemational appealed to the Govemor-General for clemency. The organization made a further appeal in August 1984 after Louis Leopold Myrtile's appeal was rejected by the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, the highest court of appeal for Mauritians.
