At least 12 possible prisoners of conscience were detained; five of them were reportedly sentenced to prison terms after a secret trial.
In June the Government of Sultan Qa-boos Bin Sa'id issued a decree allowing women to stand for election to the Majlis al-Shura, Consultative Council. Two women were later elected to the Consultative Council, which comprises 82 seats. Four women were appointed to the State Council (senate), which was established in December.
At least 12 possible prisoners of conscience were detained at the end of Au-
gust or the beginning of September. They were reportedly suspected of being Shi'a activists. Most of them were released after several weeks in detention, but at least five were still held at the end of the year, reportedly serving prison sentences ranging from 18 months to three years. No details were available regarding the trial proceedings or the exact charges on which they were convicted. The five, all said to be members of the Shi'a commimity, reportedly included Dr Hassan Muhsan, a physician, and Jum'a Abd al-Reda Jimi'a, a manager at the Ministry of Civil Services, who were said to be serving sentences of 18 months' and three years' imprisonment, respectively.
