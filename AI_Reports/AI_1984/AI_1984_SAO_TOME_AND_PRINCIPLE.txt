Sao Tome and Principe
Three prisoners of conscience who had been adopted by Amnesty Intemational and two others whose cases were under investigation were released on 12 July on the eighth anniversary of the country's independence. The five had been sentenced to prison terms ranging from 16 to 22 years following trials in 1977 and 1979 which Amnesty Intemational believed did not accord with internationally recognized standards for a fair trial (see Amnesty Intemational Report 1983).
Amnesty Intemational was investigating the imprisonment of a primary school teacher, Lucia Carvalho, who was apparently arrested on Principe island at the beginning of the year and accused of preparing pamphlets which criticized the government She was reportedly tried in June by the Special Tribunal for Counter-Revolutionary Acts on charges r^ating to the preparation of these pamphlets and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment
A Sao Tomean citizen who had been granted political asylum in
Portugal, Antonio Trovoada, was forcibly repatriated from Angola to Sao Tome in November and immediately arrested on his arrival. He was apparendy suspected of having been in contact with an opposition political group in Portugal and was still in detention at the end of the year.
