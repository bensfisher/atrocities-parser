Continued impact of the 'war on terror'
After II September 2001, more than 250 people were arrested and detained, including military personnel and judges. The number still detained remained unknown, but they were reportedly held without access to lawyers or family, and their legal status was unclear.
Security provisions continued to be strengthened with the introduction of the Anti-terrorism Act in July Penalties for involvement with organizations defined as "terrorist" included the death penalty and life imprisonment.
The "war on terror" was also used to restrict freedom of expression, belief and association. Those perceived to have "Islamist" tendencies, including lawyers, judges, teachers and university professors, reportedly faced restrictions on work opportunities and participation in public life. The Anti-terrorism Act provided for up to five years' imprisonment for "propagating, by word, in writing or by any other means" any "terrorist" act or purpose. Organizations such as teachers', lawyers', and journalists' associations faced harassment because some of their board members were perceived to hold "Islamist" views. Some Islamic charities reportedly had their assets confiscated or frozen, and their activities blocked.
Forcible return
On 23 November, Abdelaziz Khalid Osman, a Sudanese political activist and former political prisoner in Sudan, was forcibly returned to Sudan. He was arrested at Abu Dhabi airport upon arrival from Egypt on 23 September, reportedly at the request of the Sudanese authorities. He was arrested when he arrived in Sudan and detained for "crimes against the state", and was subsequently released on 18 December.
'Disappearance'
A 34-year-old employee of the telecommunications company Etisalat, Hassan al-Za'abi, was arrested and "disappeared" after his car was stopped by members of the State Security (Amn al-Dawla) on i August in Abu Dhabi. Despite several appeals by his family his fate and whereabouts remained unknown. The reasons for his arrest were not clear but were thought to be politically motivated.
Cruel judicial punishments
In December, two women domestic migrant workers -Indonesian national Wasini bint Sarjan and Indian national Rad Zemah Sinyaj Mohammed - were sentenced to flogging, after becoming pregnant outside marriage, by a Shari'a (Islamic) Court in Ras al-Khaimah.
