ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
One prisoner was executed. One person remained under sentence of death at the end of the year.
TjTone Nicholas was hanged on 21 February. He had been sentenced to death for murder in June 1989; his appeal was dismissed in June 1990. He did not appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (jcpc) in London, the final coiul of appeal for Antigua and Barbuda. Amnesty International was concerned that he may have been unaware of the possibility of appealing to the jcpc or of requesting financial assistance to pursue such an appeal.
Amnesty International wrote to the Prime Minister, Vere C. Bird Sr, expressing dismay at the execution. It stressed the importance of providing maximum safeguards for all prisoners sentenced to death, including appeals to the jcpc. Amnesty International had received no reply by the end of the year.
