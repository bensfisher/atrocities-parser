BRUNEI DARUSSALAM
Three suspected government opponents were detained without charge or trial but four others were released.
The three were held at the Jerudong Place of Detention outside the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, under the Internal Security Enactment of 1982. This permits indefinite detention without charge or trial. Garip bin Timpus was arrested in February 1990 after returning to Brunei Darussalam from 14 years' residence in Malaysia. Garip bin Mangool was arrested in November 1990 after returning from a brief visit to Malaysia. Omar bin Tamin was arrested in June after returning from six years in Malaysia. The authorities did not make public the reasons for their arrest but it appeared that they were suspected of having links with the Partai Rakyat Brunei (prb), Brunei People's Party, The prb was banned after it staged an abortive armed rebellion in December 1962. Its leaders were detained without charge or trial until July 1973, when many escaped to Malaysia.
Four other suspected supporters of the prb, including Osman bin Haji Besar and Jeluddin bin Suleiman, were released in April. They had been detained without charge or trial since March 1989 after returning to Brunei Darussalam from Malaysia.
It was not clear at the end of the year whether or not restrictions on the freedom of movement and expression of Abdul Latif Chuchu, a former prisoner of conscience, imposed at the time of his release in March 1990, had been lifted.
