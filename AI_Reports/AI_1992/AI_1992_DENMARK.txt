DENMARK
A judicial investigation into the treatment of asylum-seekers in Copenhagen prisons, established in August 1990, had not been completed by the end of the year. The gov* emment announced that this investigation would include allegations of ill-treatment made by two foreign visitors.
In September the government published the Report to the Danish Government on the Visit to Denmark Carried Out, by the European Committee for the Prevention of
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The committee had carried out its first periodic visit to Denmark in December 1990. During this visit, the committee heard fi?om a wide range of sources about allegations that two foreign
tomists - Himid Hassan Juma and Babad-ing Fatty - had been beaten in police custody. The report acknowledged that the Ministry of Justice had initiated an inquiry in both these cases. The committee asked to be informed of the findings and the measures which the authorities intended to take as a result. The committee reported that it "...was struck by the similarity of the allegations concerning the treatment of these two individuals, both from African countries. They suggest that there might be a problem of communication with nationals of states whose languages are little known or not known at all, especially when the behaviour of the individuals concerned, for a variety of reasons - for example, a failure to understand the reasons for their detention - is disturbed."
Anmesty International had written to the Danish Government in October and December 1990 about the allegations of ill-treatment made by Himid Hassan Jimia (see Amnesty International Report 1991) and Babading Fatty (a Gambian tomrist allegedly beaten in police custody in October 1990). In February the government replied, stating that the investigation into the treatment of asylum-seekers had been expanded to include these allegations.
