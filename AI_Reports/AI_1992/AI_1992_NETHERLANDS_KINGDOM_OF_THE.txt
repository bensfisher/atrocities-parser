In June 1990 Henry K. Every died before reaching hospital in Curaçao in the Netherlands Antilles, after police allegedly kicked and beat him in the street during his arrest. In May 1991 Moreno Fabias required medical assistance for injuries he alleged were inflicted by a police officer who beat him with a truncheon on a street in Curaçao. In August the press reported that the Minister of Justice for the Netherlands Antilles had agreed to establish a commission of inquiry into allegations of ill-treatment.
Detainees in Aruba alleged they were subjected to severe beatings and other forms of torture and ill-treatment. José Luis Mengual Arriza was arrested in October 1990. He alleged that he was kicked and beaten in the stomach and kidneys by three officers in a police station. After he began to spit and urinate blood he was transferred to hospital where he required 17 days' medical treatment.
In November Amnesty International wrote to the Kingdom Minister for Justice and Netherlands Antilles and Aruban Affairs for information about the mandate of the commission of inquiry in the Netherlands Antilles. Amnesty International urged that all the allegations of ill-treat-ment should be investigated promptly, fully and impartially and that the commission's methods of work and findings be made public. Amnesty International also urged the Minister to take the necessary steps to investigate the allegations in Aruba.
