BELIZE
Five people were under sentence of death for murder. In two cases, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals. Three other
death sentences were overturned on appeal. The last execution took place in 1985.
Catalino O'Niel and Dean Vasquez were sentenced to death for minder in March and June respectively. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals in both cases and upheld the death sentences. Appeals for commutation were lodged with the Advisory Council, which advises the Governor General on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. The appeal was turned down in the case of Catalino O'Niel and no decision had been made on the case of Dean Vasquez. At the end of the year both men were applying for special leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.
In February the Court of Appeal set aside the death sentences of three people: Luis Santos, convicted of murder in 1990; and Miguel Angel Marroquin Barillas and Ricardo Allen Garcia Castillo Rivera, also convicted of murder in 1990. The court ordered a retrial in each case. All three were later convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to terms of imprisonment.
During the year Amnesty International appealed to the Attorney-General to commute the death sentences against Catalino O'Niel and Dean Vasquez.
