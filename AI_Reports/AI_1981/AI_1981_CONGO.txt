Amnesty International's main concern was detention without trial.
Former head of state Joachim Yho mbi-Opango, who was replaced as President in February 1979 by Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso, has been held in detention since March 1979. He was initially accused of high treason but has not been brought to trial. First held at Makola military camp, he has been detained at Pointe-Noire since late 1979. Three associates of former President Yhombi-Opango — Pierre Aboya, Pierre Anga and Jean-Claude Itoua — have also been detained without trial since 1979. All four cases were being investigated by

Amnesty Intemational. Two other detainees arrested at the same time — Bonaventure Engobo and Gaston Issambo — were released in August 1980.
Amnesty International received information about a number of short-term detentions. In September 1980 Bernard Mackiza, editor, and Albert Mianzoukouta, a joumalist, both employed by the newspaper La Semaine africaine, were arrested in Brazzaville and detained for two weeks. Albert Mianzoukouta had written an article criticizing the construction of a new railway bridge to link the administrative centre of Brazzaville with the residential quarter where most senior government officials live. They were reportedly denied food during the first few days in detention.
A number of refugees from Zaire were also detained during 1980. Most were students who fled fix>m Zare after a strike and demonstrations by students in Kipshasa during March and April 1980. Some, such as former student leader Pascal Nzogu, were released and allowed to leave the country within a few weeks, but others are believed to have been detained for about six months. By early 1981 all the Zairian detainees known to Amnesty Intemational had been released and permitted to travel to other countries of asylum under the auspices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
