Amnesty International's concerns were detention without trial and prison conditions.
On 15 April 1980 former President Hamani Diori and former leader of the Sawaba (Freedom) Party Djibo Bakary were released from detention. Hamani Diori had been detained since his overthrow in April 1974 by the present head of state, Colonel Seyni Kountche. Djibo Bakary had been detained without trial since 1975 for alleged involvement in an attempted coup. Hamani Diori and his son Mounkaila were effectively placed under house arrest in Niamey. However some 17 people, relatives of Hamani Diori and former officials in his government, remained in detention without charge or trial. They included Hamani Diori's brother, Djiba Balle, and two former government ministers, Aboubacar Moussa and Ibrahima Issa.
Most of the detainees were held in the remote desert prison at Agadez in the Saharan region, where conditions of detention were reported to be harsh. The remainder were held at Tillabery in southern Niger. They were apparently allowed to receive visits or letters from their families only rarely, and visits were very brief and closely

supervised by prison guards. Medical facilities were also said to be inadequate. At least two of the detainees were believed to be seriously ill. Ibro Djibo was moved to Niamey in late April 1980 where he had an operation for cancer of the bladder. The authorities freed him when they learned that the illness might prove terminal.
Three other detainees have been held for more than five years for alleged involvement in plots against the government. Cyrille Gabriel and Mai Tourare Gadjo were arrested in 1975; Sanoussi Jackou was reportedly tried in camera by a military tribunal after his arrest in 1976 but no judgment has been made public.
Shortly before the 21 st anniversary of independence on 15 April 1981 Amnesty International appealed to the authorities to bring to trial or release all these detainees. No answer was received.
