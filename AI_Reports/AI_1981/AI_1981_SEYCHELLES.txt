Seychelles
In July 1980 the government released the remaining 13 prisoners detained without charge or trial since the previous November, on condition that they went immediately into exile. Some were allegedly threatened with future reprisals if they expressed opposition to the government from abroad. The detainees, held under the Preservation of Public Security (Detention) Regulations, included Gerard Hoarau, principal immigration officer; Bernard Verlaque, journalist and publisher of the recently banned Weekend Life; and Max Racombo, secretary to the government's Planning Authority.
These detainees and 65 others released earlier had been publicly accused by the government of conspiracy to overthrow it by creating internal disturbances designed to facilitate a mercenary invasion. There was no invasion and no detainee was charged with any offence.
Amnesty International had sent a mission in January 1980 to express concern over their detention without trial and their prison conditions and had taken up their cases for investigation.
