Burundi
Amnesty International's main concerns were detention without trial and the death penalty.
Amnesty International received information about a number of students detained during the year. In late July 1980 Ladislas Nzohabonayo and Mathias Niyonzima, both leading members of the ruling party's youth wing, the Jeunesse r√©volutionnaire Rwagasore (JRR), Revolutionary Rwagasore Youth, were arrested while attending a national conference of the JRR. They were accused of disturbing the proceedings after they had apparently criticized the leaders of the JRR and encouraged them to adopt more radical policies. They were detained without charge or trial until November, when they were released. Their cases were investigated by Amnesty International.
At least two other students were arrested in early August 1980. Both had been studying abroad, one in Romania and the other in Libya. They were obliged to return home after they had protested against the reduction of their overseas study grants together with other students from Burundi. One of tliose detained was Antoine Nkes-himana, who had been studying in Bucharest. He was sent home with several other students in July 1980 and was arrested on 3 August 1980, apparently because of the protests against grant reductions. Amnesty International investigated his case. He was released uncharged in November 1980.
In July 1980 Amnesty International learned that six people had been executed in Bujumbura. Four had been convicted of violent crimes, and two of membership of the illegal A'an^a Yivuza religious sect and of ritual cannibalism.
