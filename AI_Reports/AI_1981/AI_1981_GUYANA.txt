In June 1980 an Amnesty International observer attended the trial of Dr Walter Rodney, Dr Rupert Roopnarine and Dr Omawale, leading members of the opposition Working People's Alliance. The three academics faced charges of arson after the destmction by fire of a govemment ministry and offices of the ruling People's National Congress party in July 1979. The trial was adjoumed on 6 June 1980. On 13 June Dr Rodney was killed in a bomb explosion. On 18 June Amnesty Intemational urged Prime Minister Forbes Bumham to allow an independent inquiry into his death, in view of the considerable international concern which it had created. No response was received and no independent investigation has taken place.
In December 1980 Amnesty International's observer retumed for the resumption of the trial of Drs Roopnarine and Omawale, but after two days it was again adjoumed. The trial re-opened in Febmary 1981, but was later adjoumed until April.
Allegations that defendants in a treason trial had been ill-treated during interrogation in June 1980 were upheld in April 1981 by the magistrate hearing the case, who mled that statements made by four defendants were inadmissible because they were not freely given to the police.
