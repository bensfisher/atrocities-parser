Amnesty Intemational was concemed about procedures in the trials of a number of detainees held in connection with an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the government of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
The coup attempt which was uncovered in Febmary 1980 was alleged by govemment officials to have been master-minded by former President Ibrahim Nasir, living in Singapore. The government arrested and detained a number of people said to have been involved, and at the same time members of families associated with the former President, including wives and children, were placed under house arrest. Amnesty Intemational understands that at least three people were sentenced on charges of having associated with former President Nasir. One of these, Mohamed Ismail Manniku Sikku, formerly Director of Civil Aviation, whose case was being investigated by Amnesty Intemational, was banished to an atoll in May 1980 for 10 years and a day, under a law applied retroactively making it an offence to associate with an enemy of the state.
In February 1981 the three alleged leaders of the coup attempt, Ahmed Nasseem, Kuwa Mohamed Maniku and Maisam Ali Maniku, were brought to trial charged with treason, a crime punishable by death under the penal code. In a cable sent on 6 February 1981 Amnesty Intemational appealed to President Gayoom to ensure that

trial procedures conformed to internationally recognized standards of fairness. On being informed by the Maldivian Government that it regarded the case as involving "planned acts of terrorism", Amnesty International explained in a cable of 17 March 1981 that it was concerned that the accused had been held incommunicado without access to family or legal counsel for nearly a year before being brought to trial, during which time they might have been subjected to undue pressure; that the accused did not have access to legal counsel during trial proceedings; and that they faced the death penalty. On 27 April 1981 they were sentenced to life imprisonment.
