Vanuatu
Amnesty International received reports of widespread arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment after the suppression in August 1980 of the secessionist Vemerama movement based on the island of Espiritu Santo. Amnesty Intemational learned of the arrest of approximately 1,000 people in the period August to October 1980, most of them francophone Melanesians. On 22 October 1980 Amnesty Intemational expressed its concern at reports of arbitrary detention and ill-treatment, and appealed to the government of Vanuatu to investigate reports of ill-treatment, to improve prison conditions and to ensure adequate medical treatment for prisoners. At the same time the Public Prosecutor was urged to bring to trial those charged with offences and to release those being held without charge.
On 21 November 1980 it was reported that a series of trials of people involved in the rebellion which had begun in mid-September had ended with the sentencing of Jimmy Stevens, the rebel leader, to 14 years' imprisonment on 11 charges including incitement to rebellion, training an army, and illegal arms possession. Approx-hnately 700 people were reportedly tried between mid-September and 21 November 1980. About 550 were found guilty of offences connected with the rebellion and 130 were sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from four weeks to 14 years.
