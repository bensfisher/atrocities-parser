Ecuador (the Republic of)
Amnesty International's main concern was the detention and torture of members of the Tsamaraint family who belong to the Shuar (Jivaro) Indians from the jungle region.
In August 1978, a cattle dealer was killed in eastern Ecuador in the canton of Palora, province of Morona Santiago. Immediately after his death, all Shuar Indians living in the Yawints centre were arrested by armed police. All of them except for two minors — Cruz and Jorge Tsamaraint, who were between the ages of 15 and 17 — were released for lack of evidence. The two boys were reported to have been tortured during police interrogation before charges were laid against them. On 1 December 1978, Fidel, a third brother who works as a teacher at the Kaurapi Indian Centre, was arrested. Amnesty International launched urgent actions on their behalf as it was reported that they were badly beaten and subjected to electric shocks.
There were other torture allegations from political prisoners in Quito and from young recruits from the province of Esmeraldas in the north of Ecuador.
