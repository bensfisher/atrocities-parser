Comoros (the Islamic and Federal Republic of)
On 13 May 1978, the government of President Ali Soilih was overthrown by an invasion force of white mercenaries. The new government, comprising Comorians formerly in exile or detention and the mercenary leader Bob Denard, immediately freed all political detainees but then arrested about 150 civiUans and security force officers associated with the previous government. On 29 May, former President Soilih was shot dead by security forces under mercenary command. According to the government he had attempted to escape from house arrest, but

no independent inquiry into the circumstances of his death has been held.
Following the coup, Ahmed Abdallah became President for the second time, having previously briefly held office in 1975 before he was overthrown by Ali Soilih with Denard's assistance. The republic was renamed the Islamic and Federal Republic of Comoros after a constitutional referendum in October 1978. The policies of the previous left-wing government were reversed. Denard and most other mercenaries departed in July 1978.
Among those released after thtxoup were some 20 political detainees whose cases had been taken up by Amnesty International. One of these, Ali Mroudjae, became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Abdallah government and it was to him that Amnesty International wrote in September 1978 to express concern over alleged ill-treatment of those detained after the coup, and to ask that they be accorded fair trial. Subsequently, Amnesty International urged President Abdallah to release all political prisoners at the time of the constitutional referendum in October 1978. In response, the President informed Amnesty International that most of the detainees had been freed under a special decree to mark the adoption of the new constitution. The remainder, he stated, would receive a fair trial: but no trial has taken place and there have been further arrests of political opponents of the government.
