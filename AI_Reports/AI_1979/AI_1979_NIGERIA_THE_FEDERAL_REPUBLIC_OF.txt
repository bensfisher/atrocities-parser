Nigeria (the Federal Republic of)
On 21 September 1978, the head of the Federal Military Government, Lieutenant-General Olusegun Obasanjo, announced the end of the state of emergency imposed when the military took power in 1966, and the legalization of political activities. Five political parties were officially registered in December.
The new constitution providing for the return to civilian rule is due to come into force on 1 October 1979. There will be an executive president, a bicameral legislative assembly and executive state governors. It was drafted by a special civilian assembly, but was subsequently amended by the ruling Supreme Military Council to include, among other things, the retention of the National Security Organization, Nigeria's security police.
Under a decree issued at the time the emergency was withdrawn, the military government introduced new powers of detention without trial. This was interpreted as a precautionary measure to ensure that the removal of restrictions on political activity did not lead to ethnic hostility. No reports of detentions were received by Amnesty International.
Amnesty International knows of no prisoners of conscience in Nigeria, but is concerned at the use of the death penalty. Many executions take place each year, though precise figures are not known. Executions in public of convicted armed robbers, which had been in abeyance for some six months, were resumed in
30
March 1979 when five prisoners were executed by firing squad in Lagos following a public outcry at the increase in violent crime. Those executed had been sentenced to death by a special tribunal consisting of a High Court judge sitting with one military officer and one police officer, in accordance with the Armed Robbery Decree 1970.
The death penalty is retained in the new constitution.
