Brunei (the Sultanate of)
Amnesty International has continued to work for the release of eight adopted prisonere who are held without trial under emergency orders. In December 1978, an Amnesty International mission visited Brunei in order to discuss the cases of these prisoners with the government. But the Sultan, Sir Hassanal Bolkiah, refused to grant interviews to the two delegates.
The eight men are all former members of the Partai Rakyat Brunei (People's Party of Brunei), which was banned in December 1962. At that time, the Partai Rakyat held all the elected seats in the Legislative Council but was unable to form a government because its elected representatives were outnumbered by members of the Council nominated by the Sultan. The Partai Rakyat announced the formation of an independent government of Brunei, but the Sultan declared a state of emergency (which is still in force) and invoked a treaty with the United Kingdom by which British troops were called in to suppress the Partai Rakyat revolt. Approximately 2,500 Partai Rakyat members and supporters were arrested and detained. Although the others have been released over the years, the eight adopted prisoners have continued to be detained without trial in connection with the revolt of 1962.
By releasing some 40 other adopted prisoners over the last five years, the government has demonstrated that it does not consider the detainees represent a threat to the security of Brunei, which for a long time was the reason given for continuing to imprison them. Particularly in view of the fact that most of the eight remaining men have already spent 16 years or more in detention without charge or trial. Amnesty International has urged their immediate release.
