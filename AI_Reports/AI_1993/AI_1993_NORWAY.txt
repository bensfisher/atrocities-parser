NORWAY
Two conscientious objectors were imprisoned for their refusal to perform military service. They were considered to be prisoners of conscience.
Jan Otto Nilsen had originally been granted conscientious objector status in 1982 on the grounds of his pacifism, but diu-ing alternative service he informed the authorities that he no longer considered himself to be an absolute pacifist. He stated that he could not perform military service while Norway was part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (nato), whose strategy was based on nuclear weapons. A court in 1986 found that his newly expressed convictions did not fulfil the requfrements necessary for alternative service; subsequently the Ministry of Justice withdrew his conscientious objector status. He was imprisoned from October to December 1990 for refusing to obey military call-up orders. Jan Otto Nilsen refused to respond to a further call-up for military service and he was imprisoned in June 1992 at the start of another 90-day sentence.
Kjetil Ramberg began serving a 90-day prison sentence in September after a county court ruled that he did not have a sufficiently "firm and unequivocal basic pacifist attitude" to obtain exemption from military service. He had declared his opposition to Norway's participation in nato's nuclear strategy.
Amnesty International urged the immediate release of prisoners of conscience Jan Otto Nilsen and Kjetil Ramberg. The government replied that neither of them had fulfilled the conditions for exemption because their convictions lacked "firmness and strength".
