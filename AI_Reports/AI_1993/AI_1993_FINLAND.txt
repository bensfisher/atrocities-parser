One conscientious objector was impris« oned for refiising to perform military service. Three conscientious objectors were released after serving their sentences. All four were considered prisoners of conscience.
Marko Ulvila, a conscientious objector to military service, began serving a 75-day prison sentence in September. He had been convicted under a temporary law on alternative service which was in force from 1987 to the end of 1991.
Three conscientious objectors were released after serving sentences imposed in 1991: Janne Mäkinen, Timo Tapani Karja-lainen and Kari Hämäläinen (see Amnesty International Report 1992).

A new law on alternative service took effect on 1 January. According to the law, a conscript who refuses to perform military service for reasons of conscience will be exempted from it during peacetime and will be allowed to perform alternative civilian service. The length of alternative service was reduced from 16 to 13 months.
Amnesty International welcomed the new law insofar as it offered an alternative service of comparable length to military service, which is between eight and 11 months' duration. The organization was concerned, however, that alternative service is available to conscientious objectors only during peacetime. Amnesty International believes that it is of particular importance that individuals are able to exercise their right to freedom of conscience at a time of actual military conflict. The organization urged the government, therefore, to allow conscientious objectors to perform alternative service during military conflicts as well as in peacetime.
Amnesty International urged the immediate release of the detained conscientious objectors because it considered the length of the alternative service under the previous law (twice the length of ordinary military service) to have been punitive.
