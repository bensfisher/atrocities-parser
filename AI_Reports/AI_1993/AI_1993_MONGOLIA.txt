MONGOLIA
Twenty-two people were sentenced to death and at least 11 executions were carried out.
A new Constitution entered into force in February. It incorporates a number of human rights guarantees found in the principal international human rights instruments, and includes for the first time an explicit prohibition of torture. Elections in
June to a restyled 76-seat legislature were won overwhelmingly by the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.
Mongolia retained the death penalty for eight peacetime offences. Official statistics indicated that 22 people were sentenced to death in 1992 and at least 11 people were executed. Execution is by shooting. The Justice Minister reported to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in July that preparations for a new criminal code envisaged a reduction in the number of capital offences.
Amnesty International continued to call on the government headed by President Puntsalmaagiyn Ochirbat to abolish the death penalty. In June Amnesty International published a report, Mongolia: Continuing legislative reform.
