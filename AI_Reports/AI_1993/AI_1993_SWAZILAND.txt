SWAZILAND
The government announced that it intended to execute prisoners for the first time since 1983. At least six prisoners were believed to be under sentence of death at the end of the year, but no executions were carried out. A former prisoner of conscience was subjected to harassment.
There was continuing pressure for reform of the tinkhundla system of indirectly elected government. Although political power remained in the hands of the

monarchy, political parties, all of which were technically illegal, became increasingly active during the year.
In September the Minister of Justice announced that for the first time since 1983 prisoners who had been sentenced to death would be executed. At least six prisoners were believed to be under sentence of death at the end of the year, all of them convicted of murder, including at least two people sentenced in 1992. However, no executions were reported.
Ray Russon, a university lecturer and former prisoner of conscience, was arrested in April on charges of theft and released on bail. In September he was acquitted of at least one charge but reportedly faced further charges. These charges, as well as other harassment of Ray Russon and his family, appeared to be related to his advocacy of political change. In 1990 and 1991 he had been repeatedly arrested and either charged with treason or detained without charge.
The report of a judicial commission of inquiry into events at the University of Swaziland campus in November 1990, when at least 80 students required hospital treatment as a result of beatings by police and soldiers (see Amnesty International Reports 1991 and 1992), was submitted to the government but had not been made public by the end of the year.
Amnesty International called on the government of King Mswati II to commute the sentences of all those awaiting execution as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty.
