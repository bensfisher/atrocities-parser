IRELAND
Three former prisoners continued to press for the re>examination of allegations that they had been ill-treated in police custody.
Ireland signed the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in September, but had not yet ratified it by the end of the year.
Nicky Kelly was given a government pardon in April. He had been convicted in 1978, along with Osgur Breatnach and Brian McNally, of involvement in the 1976 Sallins mail train robbery, solely on the basis of confessions allegedly obtained by ill-treatment during incommunicado detention (see Amnesty International Reports 1990 to 1992). In 1980 the Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that the confessions of Osgur Breatnach and Brian McNally had been involuntary and quashed their convictions. Nicky Kelly was released on "humanitarian grounds" in 1984. The three continued to press for re-examination, through civil proceedings, of their allegations that they had been ill-treated in police custody.
Amnesty International welcomed the pardon for Nicky Kelly, but continued to urge the government to establish an independent inquiry into all the allegations of ill-treatment in custody made in connection with the Sallins robbery case.
