Sedition charges against seven civil rights activists were dropped. There were allegations that six people sentenced to jail terms for obstructing the police had been ill-treated in custody.
Former Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka became Prime Minister after national elec-
tions in May. The elections were held under the 1990 Constitution which guarantees power for indigenous Fijians. Prime Minister Rabuka, leader of the Soqosoqo Ni Vakavulewa M Taukei (svt), Fijian Political Party, the dominant party in the ruling coalition government, had led two military coups in 1987 (see Amnesty International Reports 1988 and 1989).
Sedition charges against seven civil rights activists who had participated in non-violent protests against the country's new Constitution in October 1990 were dropped (see Amnesty International Reports 1991 and 1992). The seven included Dr Anirudh Singh, who had been abducted and tortured by army officers in October 1990.
Six miners who were sentenced to jail terms for obstructing police officers and damaging police vehicles were reportedly ill-treated in custody. They said they had been beaten and punched by police officers. The miners also alleged that they were not given adequate time to consult their lawyers before the trial. They had been arrested in February during a clash between police and striking miners at a gold mine in Vatukoula town which resulted in the death of a comt official trying to enforce an eviction order.
An Amnesty International representative visited Fiji in May to discuss the organization's concerns with government officials, including Solicitor-General Fili-mone Jitoko.
