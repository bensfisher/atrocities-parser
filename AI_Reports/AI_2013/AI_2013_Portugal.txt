There were reports of excessive use of force by police against demonstrators and Roma. Domestic violence remained a serious concern.
Torture and other ill-treatment

A criminal investigation into the use of a Taser against an inmate in Pa√ßos de Ferreira prison in 2010 did not progress despite the findings of an inquiry by the Audit and Inspection services of the General Directorate for prisons that two members of the Prison Security Intervention Group had used the weapon disproportionately. The outcome of disciplinary proceedings against the two prison officers remained pending at the end of the year.
The trial of three police officers accused of torturing Virgolino Borges in March 2000 while in police custody, which started in November 2011, made little progress.
