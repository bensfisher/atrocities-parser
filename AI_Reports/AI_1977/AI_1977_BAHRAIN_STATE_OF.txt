Bahrain (State of)
Numerous people, including many of Amnesty International's former adopted prisoners, were reportedly detained in November 1976, following the murder, of the owner-editor of the conservative weekly magazine Al-Mawakef. Although five men were subsequently charged with the crime and brought to trial in December 1976, many others who were arrested remained in prison and to Amnesty International's knowledge have not yet been charged with any offence. At the trial, the prosecution alleged that the defendants were members of the banned left-wing Popular Front for the Liberation of the Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG) and said that the killing was politically motivated and a threat to Bahrain's security. But the three defendants denied this and said that they had acted under the influence of alcohol. On 5 March 1977, the death sentences passed on two of the men were confirmed by the Appeals Court, which at the same time changed the sentence of life imprisonment passed on the third man to that of death. Amnesty International appealed against the sentences, but the three men were executed on 8 March 1977.
In January 1977, Amnesty International received reports that approximately 50 men still in detention were being tortured and that at least two, Mohammed Buchery and Said Alaw'ianati, had died under torture. Other detainees were said to be in hospital as a result of torture. On 11 January Amnesty International appealed to the Prime Minister of Bahrain, Shaikh Khalifa Bin-Sulman al-Khalifa, to intervene personally to protect all those still in prison. An Urgent Action campaign was launched asking for the release of those detainees not charged with any offence and for an immediate investigation into torture allegations.
Amnesty International groups are working on the cases of 19 prisoners in Bahrain.
