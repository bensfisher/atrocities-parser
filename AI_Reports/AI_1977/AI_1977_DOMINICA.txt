Group work continued on the case of Desmond Trotter, sentenced to death in 1974 for the murder of an American tourist. Following the retraction of testimony by the chief prosecution witness, Desmond Trotter was reprieved in April 1976 and his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. Amnesty International believes that there are sufficient doubts about the case to justify a retrial. Desmond Trotter has always maintained that he is innocent and that his political activities were the reason for his arrest and conviction.
