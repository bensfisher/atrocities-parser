Amnesty International continued to handle the cases of 18 members of the left-wing Saioaba movement, who were arrested in October 1975 and detained without trial. There were no positive reactions from the Government to thegroups'workonbehalfoftheseprisoners.
Although in April 1976 Amnesty International appealed to President Seyni Kountche to commute the death sentences passed on nine people for their part in an attempted coup on 14 March 1976, seven were executed on 21 April 1976 including the alleged coup leaders, Major Moussa Bayere, Captain Sidi Mohamed and Ahmed Moudour.
Former President Hamani Diori, who was overthrown in a military coup on 16 April 1974, is still being held in a small three-room lodging built for him at Zinder military camp. Although his living conditions, according to recent reports, are relatively good, he is reported to be seriously ill and his sight is rapidly failing. Former President Diori is said to be sharing his lodging with his former Education Minister, Mr Kackou; and some other members of his Government are still under house arrest.
