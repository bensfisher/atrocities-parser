On 2 July 1976, Amnesty International wrote to the Canadian Minister of Justice, the Honourable Ron Basford, appealing against the extradition to the United States of an American Indian, Leonard
130
Peltier. The organization stated its belief that "American Indians and leaders of the American Indian Movement in particular are harassed and persecuted by law enforcement agencies in the United States because of their political activities".
Leonard Peltier, a leading figure in the American Indian Movement, was wanted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for his alleged involvement in the killing of two FBI agents on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota on 26 June
1975.	In October 1976 James Lockyer, a British lawyer, went as an Amnesty International observer to the Federal Court of Appeal hearings on Peltier's extradition. In letters sent to the Canadian Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, and to Mr Basford on 19 November
1976,	Amnesty International repeated the doubt that Leonard Peltier would receive a fair trial in the United States and referred to James Lockyer's report on the c^e, which "indicates contradictions within the evidence which has been presented in justification of the extradition order". Once again an appeal against extradition was made on the grounds that "the case may be one of a political rather than of a criminal nature".
Leonard Peltier was extradited to the United States on 18 December 1976. He subsequently stood trial for murder in April 1977 and was convicted, but at the time of writing his sentence has not been pronounced (see also United States of America).
