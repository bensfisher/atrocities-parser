Saudi Arabia (Kingdom of)
Efforts have continued during the year to establish how many of the 200 political prisoners known by name to Amnesty International were released in the amnesty for political prisoners announced in
312
April 1975. Forty-four of them had been adopted by Amnesty Inter-nationd. However, no new information has been received during the past year, either about those who were released, or about any who have since been arrested for political reasons.
Executions for criminal offences in Saudi Arabia are rarely publicized, but two executions were widely reported in 1977, either because of the nature of the offences, or because of the method of execution. On 25 February two men were publicly beheaded for indecently assaulting a boy they had kidnapped. The Govemment had approved the death sentences, it was said, because it wanted to make an example of the men. In March three married men were stoned to death and an unmarried man was beheaded for kidnapping and raping a woman. The crime was considered particularly grave because it had been committed during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
Justice in Saudi Arabia is administered according to Islamic law, which makes certain examples of sexual immorality, such as adultery between two married people, f^nication and sodomy, punishable by death, so long as the offence can be proved either by statements from four witnesses to the act, or by the confession of the accused. The traditional punishment is death by stoning for both men and women. These are the first reports of executions for sexual offences, and the first of stonings to death, that Amnesty International has received. Amnesty International is seeking further information about the imposition of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia before this matter is taken up with the authorities.
