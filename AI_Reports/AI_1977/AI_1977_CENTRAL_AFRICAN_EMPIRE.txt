Central African Empire
In December 1976, President Jean-Bedel Bokassa proclaimed the Central African Republic an empire and himself Emperor Bokassa I.
On 8 December 1976, Amnesty Intemational cabled a message of congratulations to the new Emperor, also requested him to grant a general amnesty to all political prisoners in the Empire.
Two days later, Amnesty Intemational received a reply which stated that the Emperor had decreed "imperial grade" for all prisoners in the imperial territory, and that they would be released step by step with the exception of a small group of not more than seven people who were condemned for crimes against state security and for embezzlement of large amounts of public funds.
The cable stated that the United Nations resident representative in Bangui had been invited to visit the central prison after the releases.
The response included an invitation to Amnesty Intemational to attend the Emperor's coronation ceremony at a date to be fixed later. As a follow-up to the announcement of a general amnesty, Amnesty Intemational wrote to the authorities for detailed information on the group of seven who would not be affected by the imperial clemency.
Groups have been working on two adopted cases in the Central African Empire, Jean-Richard Sandos, the Secretary-General of the Union Générale des Travailleurs Centrafricains, and his deputy, J.B. Malikanga. Amnesty Intemational is attempting to establish
67
whether or not these two prisoners were freed in the December 1976 amnesty.
