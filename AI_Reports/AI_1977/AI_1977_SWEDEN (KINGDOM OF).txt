Sweden (Kingdom of)
Jonas Linderholm, one of two Conscientious Objectors whose cases were adopted by Amnesty International in 1976, was released in May 1976 after he had been on hunger-strike for 18 days. He served half his two month sentence. Mats Amvall, the only other adoption case, was released in October 1976, after serving a two month sentence, his third and last term of imprisonment for refusal to perform military service. Amnesty Intemational has taken up very few cases of Conscientious Objectors in Sweden because of the short sentences and difficulty in ascertaining when a Conscientious Objector will enter prison. There is often a long delay between sentencing and entering prison. However, it is estimated that about 800 persons a year are sentenced to between one and three months'imprisonment for refusal to perform military service. Although there is provision in Swedish law

for alternative service, applicants may be turned down, if for example, the reasons for their objections are political or of "questionable" sincerity. Amnesty Intemational does not have statistics on the number of possible Conscientious Objectors rejected, since many of those who go to prison refuse to apply for alternative service. A proposed revision of the law on conscientious objection is at present being discussed by the Govemment.
