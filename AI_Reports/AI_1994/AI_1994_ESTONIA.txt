ESTONIA
Two people were sentenced to death.
Estonia became a member of the Council of Europe in May and signed the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocol No. 6 concerning abolition of the deáth penalty. It had not ratified either instrument by the end of the year.
Two people were sentenced to death, both for the crime of aggravated murder. Both men were believed to be still under sentence of death at the end of the year. Two people under sentence of death át the end of 1992 had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment by President Lennart Meri. The last execution took place in September 1991.
Amnesty International appealed for commutation of the death sentences and urged the authorities to consider the complete abolition of the death penalty.
In January Amnesty International published a report entitled The Baltic States: Time to abolish the death penalty.
