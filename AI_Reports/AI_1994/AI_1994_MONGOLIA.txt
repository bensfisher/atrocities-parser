MONGOLIA
At least one death sentence was passed.
In June President Puntsalmaagiyn Ochirbat was re-elected in Mongolia's first direct presidential elections. Nominated by opposition parties, he defeated the candidate of the ruling Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.
Amendments to the criminal code which came into force in August reduced the number of offences punishable by death to five: premeditated murder, aggravated rape or rape of a minor, and three anti-state offences involving violence. The offences for which the death penalty was abolished included treason.
One death sentence was reported. The true figure was probably much higher, but official statistics for death sentences and executions during the year were not available.
Amnesty International continued to call on the authorities to commute all death sentences and to take steps to abolish the death penalty.
