HUNGARY
At least 70 prisoners of conscience imprisoned for conscientious objection to military service were released. A civilian alternative to military service was introduced. The number of offences punishable by death was reduced and it became constitutionally impossible to implement the death penalty while the role of the body which hears requests for commutation of death sentences was under review.
Political changes continued throughout the year under Prime Minister Mikl6s N6meth, who replaced Kdroly Gr6sz as premier at the end of 1988. In October the ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers Party voted itself out of existence and a new party, the Hungarian Socialist Party, was set up in its place under the chairmanship of Rezso Nyers.
The Ministry of lustice stated in March that all imprisoned conscientious objectors had been released pending legislation which would allow a civilian alternative to military service. In June the Hungarian Parliament passed legislation to allow conscientious objectors to perform alternative service in non-military institutions. The alternative service will be for 10 months longer than military service, but those undertaking it will not be confined to barracks or be called up for subsequent reserve service. In luIy legislation was adopted abolishing the death penalty for crimes against the state.
Amnesty International welcomed the release of imprisoned conscientious objectors, on whose behalf it had been appealing. The organization also urged the Hungarian Government to abolish the
death penalty. In September Prime Minister Mikl6s N6meth informed Amnesty International that it was constitutionally impossible to carry out the death penalty as the role of the Presidential Council — the body which hears requests for commutation of death sentences — was under review.
