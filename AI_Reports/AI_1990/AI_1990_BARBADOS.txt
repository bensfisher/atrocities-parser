BARBADOS
Eight death sentences were commuted during the year, including those of two juvenile offenders. Legislation was approved raising to 18 the minimum age for imposition of the death penalty. There were no executions, but at least three people were sentenced to death. Nine people remained on death row at the end of the year.
The death sentences of Patrick Greaves and Michael Taylor were commuted to life imprisonment on 20 November. At the time of the crime they were 17 years old.
On 21 November the House of Assembly voted unanimously to prohibit the execution of people aged under 18 years at the time of the crime. In December the Senate approved this amendment to the Juvenile Offenders Act, bringing Barbados' law into line with international standards. Barbados had been one of only five countries in the world known to have executed during the past decade someone aged under 18 at the time of the offence: Martin Marsh was executed in 1982 for a crime committed when he was 17 years old.
In December Amnesty International wrote to the government welcoming the commutations granted during the year, including those of Patrick Greaves and Michael Taylor. Amnesty International had made numerous appeals on behalf of Greaves and Taylor and had called for the commutation of all death sentences. The organization also welcomed the legislation abolishing the death penalty for juveniles and urged the government to take steps towards the total abolition of the penalty.
