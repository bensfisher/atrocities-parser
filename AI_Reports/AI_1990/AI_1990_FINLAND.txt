FINLAND
Three conscientious objectors to military service began serving prison sentences; six others were released on completion of their sentences. All nine were considered prisoners of conscience.
In May Finland became the 23rd member state of the Council of Europe. On 5 May Finland signed the European Convention on Human Rights and its Protocol No. 6 concerning the abolition of the death penalty. It had not ratified these instruments by the end of the year. In August Finland ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
Finnish law on unarmed and civilian service was last amended in 1987, extending the right to perform alternative civilian service to every applicant objecting to military conscription on ethical or religious grounds. However, the 1987 law also increased the length of alternative service from 12 to 16 months: twice as long as military service.
Three conscientious objectors began serving 12-month sentences in June: Karri Dyrendahl-Nyblin and Tomi Saarinen, both painters; and Juha Kanerva, a student. They had refused to perform alternative service partly on the grounds that the length was punitive.
Six conscientious objectors previously adopted as prisoners of conscience were released after serving their sentences: Markku Tattari in February, Jarmo Kaarlela in April, Raimo Rautiainen in June, Harri Mäkels and Pekka Ylönen in July, and Jukka Seppälä in November (see Amnesty International Report 1989).
Amnesty International considered that because of its punitive length civilian service did not provide an acceptable alternative to military service and sought the release of conscientious objectors it considered prisoners of conscience.
