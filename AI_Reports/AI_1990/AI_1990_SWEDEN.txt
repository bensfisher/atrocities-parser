Seven Kurdish refugees from TXirkey remained under tovra arrest for the entire year as a resuh of an administrative order imposed by the government in 1984.
Originally the restrictions on freedom of movement had been imposed on nine Kurdish refugees, who were suspected by the government of being terrorists (see Amnesty International Report 1989). The government had declared that they could not be deported to TXirkey because they risked persecution there. Instead, the government imposed restrictions on their freedom of movement in accordance with anti-terrorist provisions in the Aliens Act. The Kurds had to report three times a week to the police and could not leave or change their town of residence without permission from the police. Breach of any of these regulations could result in imprisonment
for up to one year.
In August the government lifted the restrictions on two of the Kurdish refugees. It also eased restrictions on two of the others, although they remained under town arrest.
By the end of 1989 the government had not responded to a December 1988 letter from Amnesty International asking about the procedures used to impose restrictions on the Kurds and about review procedures. The organization was concerned that the authorities had not indicated when these resfrictions might be lifted. It was also concerned that the restrictions had been administratively rather than judicially imposed and that the-legality of the restrictions could not be challenged before a court. In October copies of the letter to the government were sent by Amnesty International to members of a parliamentary committee set up to review the anti-terrorist provisions in the Aliens Act.
