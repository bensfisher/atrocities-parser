DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
Short-term arrests of demonstrators and trade unionists were reported in the context of labour unrest. As in previous years there were violent clashes between the police and demonstrators, resulting in the death of three demonstrators and the
injury of many others. Several people were reported to have been threatened in detention and to have been kept in police custody in spite of a judicial order for their release. The government failed to clarify the fate of two people who had "disappeared" in previous years.
Arrests of demonstrators and trade unionists were reported in the context of a general strike on 19 and 20 June to protest against the economic policies of the government of President Joaquin Balaguer. Violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators resulted int the death of three demonstrators and the injury of many others. On 30 June Rafael Santo, the Secretary-General of the Dominican Teachers' Association, was detained with other teachers diuing a march held in Santo Domingo in support of higher salaries and other demands.
On 7 May police detained Roberto Duvergé Mejía. an elderly university professor; Fernando Peña Segura, a politics graduate; and Luis Lizardo, a mechanic, accusing them of responsibility for a series of bomb explosions. They were reportedly threatened while held in custody. The release of Roberto Duvergé and Fernando Peña, ordered by a judge and regional attorney owing to lack of evidence but ignored by the police for at least three weeks, did not take place until 17 June. Luis Lizardo continued to await trial in La Victoria prison.
No further information was received on the fate of Pablo Liberato Rodríguez or Luis Samuel Roche, who "disappeared" in 1974 and 1982 respectively (see Amnesty International Report 1979, 1983 and 1985 to 1989].
In June Amnesty International appealed on behalf of Roberto Duvergé, Fernando Peña and Luis Lizardo, requesting clarification of their exact legal situation.
