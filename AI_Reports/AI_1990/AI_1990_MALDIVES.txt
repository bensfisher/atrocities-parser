MALDIVES
Sixteen people convicted of involvement in an attempted coup in 1988 were sentenced to death. The sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment.
The trial of over 70 people involved in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the
government of President Maimioon Abdul Gayoom in November 1988 (see Amnesty International Report 1989] ended in August. Four Maldivians and 12 Sri Lankan nationals were sentenced to death. The remaining defendants — all Sri Lankan nationals — received prison sentences of between 17 and 38 years.
The sentences were passed by the High Court of the Maldives in the capital, Male. The defendants did not have access to a lawyer and there is no higher court of appeal. However, President Gayoom commuted all 16 death sentences to life imprisonment in October.
Amnesty International, which had appealed for the death sentences to be commuted, was informed by President Gayoom in October that he had granted clemency "considering the best interests of the country and, in particular, the importance of adhering to a long-standing tradition of not carrying out death sentences". He said the decision was made "purely on humanitarian and nationalistic grounds in an effort to ensure a climate of peace and stability for future generations".
