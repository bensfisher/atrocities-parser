JAPAN
A prisoner sentenced to death in 1958 was acquitted and released, and another sentenced to death in 1975 was granted a retrial. One person was executed.
Emperor Hirohito died on 7 January and
was succeeded by his son, who became Emperor Akihito. An amnesty granted in February in honoiu of the late Emperor did not affect prisoners imder sentence of death.
An estimated 90 prisoners convicted of murder were believed to be under sentence of death. The Supreme Court had confirmed around 35 of these sentences, three of them in 1989. Takekazu Kondo was executed in November at the Fukuoka Detention Centre. He had been sentenced to death in 1972 on charges that included miurder and arson.
In January the Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of Masao Akahori on a charge of miuder. At his retrial, the court ruled that his confession lacked credibility and that no other evidence linked him to the crime (see Amnesty International Report 1989). He was the fourth prisoner sentenced to death to be acquitted in a retrial since 1983.
In June the Supreme Court ordered the retrial of Norio Shimogami, who was sentenced to death in 1975 for murder. The court ruled that his conviction was based on the unreliable confession of an alleged accomplice and was contradicted by material evidence. The first hearing of the retrial took place in December.
An Amnesty International delegation visited Japan during February and March and met senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, judiciary and police. The delegates expressed concern about the use of the death penalty, sought information about detention procedures and emphasized the importance of effective safeguards against ill-treatment.
Amnesty International continued to press for the commutation of all death sentences and to urge the authorities to abolish the death penalty.
