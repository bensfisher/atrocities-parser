BERMUDA
The only prisoner under sentence of death had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment. No executions had been carried out for 12 years.
Troy Shqfter had been sentenced to death in 1987 for premeditated murder. In February the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which acts as Bermuda's final court of appeal, rejected Troy Shorter's petition for leave to appeal. However, in March the Governor, Sir Desmond Langley, commuted the death sentence.
On 10 March a parliamentary bill was introduced to abolish the death penalty for all crimes. On 28 April parliament decided to postpone the vote for six months. On 3 June it passed an act providing for a public referendum to take place within the following six months on the issue of "whether or
BERMUDA/BHUTAN/BOLIVIA
not capital punishment for premeditated murder is favoured in Bermuda". The referendum viould not be binding on parha-ment, which would be free to debate the issue again. Neither the referendum nor the postponed parliamentary vote had taken place by the end of the year.
Amnesty International wrote to Bermuda's Governor General in March welcoming the decision to commute Troy Shorter's death sentence. In April the organization wrote to Prime Minister John Swan welcoming the future debate in parliament on the death penalty and urging that parliament take the decisive step of abolishing the penalty.
