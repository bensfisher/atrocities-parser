In January, six men were convicted of the murder of Carlos Cardoso, editor of a daily newspaper, in November 2000.

Five received prison terms of 23 years and six months each, and one, Aníbal dos Santos Júnior, was sentenced in absentia to 28 years' imprisonment for the murder and related offences. In December the
Attorney General visited the six men in prison after hearing that they were being held in leg-cuffs or chains, apparently as a security measure. He declared such restraint illegal. A few days later, the businessmen and bank manager went on trial in connection with the bank fraud.
In September a court acquitted seven police officers who had been charged with assisting Aníbal dos Santos Junior to escape from prison in September 2002. The judge said that the defendants had been used as scapegoats to "protect those who were untouchable".
