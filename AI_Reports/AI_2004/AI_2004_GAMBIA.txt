In September Gambia signed the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa.
Attacks on freedom of expression
In June the new National Media Commission was inaugurated. The Gambia Press Union lodged a legal action with the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the Commission. The Commission has considerable quasi-judicial powers, including the power to force journalists to reveal sources and to impose mandatory licensing conditions, and lacks independence. However, the Supreme Court was not functioning so the legal action was not heard.
The /ndependenf newspaper came under particular attack and several of its staff received death threats, were ill-treated or were detained. Its editor-in-chief, Abdoulaye Sey, was detained for three days in September by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) following publication of an article critical of President Jammeh. NIA agents denied holding him, prompting fears for his safety. NIA agents also reportedly threatened that he would be killed if he continued to publish articles critical of the President. Abdoulaye Sey was released without charge.
In October, three unidentified men set fire to The Independent's premises. The newspaper's security guard was beaten unconscious. A police inquiry was announced but did not appear to take place.

Fate of suspected coup plotters
In July, two men suspected of involvement in a July 1996 attack on military barracks in Farafenni were arrested shortly after returning to the country from Liberia. The circumstances of their return were unclear. They had not been formally charged by the end of the year. Three other men sentenced to death in June 1997 for involvement in the attack were stili awaiting the outcome of the state's appeal against the quashing of their sentence in late 1997. All the men remained in detention.

Trial of political opponents
In December the judge in the trial of opposition leader Ousainou Darboe and four of his supporters, charged with the murder of a government supporter in 2000, ruled that the trial should proceed even though one of the defendants would be tried in absentia. Defence lawyers appealed against the decision arguing it was unconstitutional. The Appeal Court had not ruled by the end of the year. The charge was believed to be politically motivated.
Lamine Waa Juwara, leader of the National Democratic Action Movement, was charged with sedition in September after calling for protests against the government which he accused of corruption and economic incompetence.
Female genital mutilation

Three people testified before Kanifing Magistrates' Court in October that they had been ill-treated in custody. One woman reportedly miscarried as a result. In May, two police officers were arrested in Brikama following accusations that they had beaten a suspect.
