Background
In March the Commonwealth upheld Zimbabwe's suspension from its governing councils until the December Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Abuja. Nigeria. At the December meeting, Commonwealth leaders voted to maintain the suspension and Zimbabwe withdrew from the organization. In May the heads of state of South Africa, Nigeria and Malawi visited Zimbabwe in an attempt to mediate talks between the MDC and ZANU-PF. The country's economic situation steadily deteriorated, with rampant inflation and unemployment, and critical shortages in basic food commodities, fuel and cash.
In July President Mugabe announced in Parliament plans to introduce legislation to govern nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and to amend the National Council for Higher Education Act. There were concerns that the proposed laws would further restrict the rights of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.
The government reportedly established training camps throughout the country for youth militia members, increasing concerns about the use of youth militia to carry out serious human rights violations against the government's perceived political enemies.
Four men convicted of murder and sentenced to death were hanged in June.
Elections
Local council, mayoral and parliamentary by-elections were the occasion for increased intimidation and politically motivated violence by government forces and supporters, mostly against opposition supporters,
Q Parliamentary by-elections in March in Kuwadzana and Highfield, two suburbs in the capital, Harare, were
marred by violence. State-sponsored militia, police and rul ing party supporters harassed and attacked MDC candidates and supporters.

It appeared that he was arrested because, injanuary, he had ordered the release of Elias Mudzuri, the Executive Mayor of Harare and an MDC member, arrested with 21 town councillors and municipal workers and charged with holding an unauthorized political meeting. In September the Supreme Court ruled that Justice Paradza's arrest was unlawful and unconstitutional. The charges against Elias Mudzuri were later withdrawn.
