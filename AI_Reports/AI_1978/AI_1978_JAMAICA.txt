Jamaica
Throughout the year 1977-78, Amnesty International continued to receive appeals for help from men sentenced to death for murder in Jamaica, and on five occasions wrote to the Governor General, Florizel Glasspole, asking him to commute individual death sentences and to use his influence against the use of the death penalty in general. In November 1977, the organization appealed to the Prime Minister, Michael Manley, to give his full support to any move towards abolition of the death penalty.
In November 1977 the Amnesty International researcher responsible for Jamaica visited the island and while there had meetings with lawyers, legal aid workers and other people concerned with human rights. At St Catherine District Prison she talked with Ransford Thomas, one of 51 men under sentence of death in Jamaica at that time. The most recent execution in Jamaica was in April 1976.
