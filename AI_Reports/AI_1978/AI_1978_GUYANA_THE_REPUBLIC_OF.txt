Guyana (the Republic of)
During the past year, Amnesty International continued to follow the case of Arnold Rampersaud, a member of the opposition People's Progressive Party, who, in July 1974, was charged with the murder of a policeman, and tried three times on the same charge because juries twice failed to reach a verdict (see Amnesty International Report 1977). Because it had been suggested that the prosecution was politically motivated, Professor David Weissbrodt, Associate Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota, attended the third trial on Amnesty International's behalf. This took place in November and December 1977. On 14 December, Arnold Rampersaud was acquitted and released, having spent three and a half years in prison.
On 10 March 1978, Amnesty International wrote to Mohamed Shahabuddeen, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General, to express concern about reports that sugar workers involved in a strike had been harassed by police and subjected to repeated arrest and short periods of detention without any charges being brought against them. The case of Jeewan Jankie, field representative of the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers Union was cited as an example.
