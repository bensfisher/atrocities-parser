Lesotho (the Kingdom of)
During the past year (July 1977-June 1978), the number of political prisoners in Lesotho continued to diminish. Fourteen supporters of the opposition Basuto-land Congress Party (BCP), most of whose cases had been taken up for investigation by Amnesty International, were released. They had been jailed in 1975, following an abortive insurrection at the beginning of 1974. Most of those freed received up to one-third remission and had therefore completed their sentences. Nine other BCP supporters are still held in Maseru Central Prison. It is expected that they, too, will receive full remission and be released when their sentences are completed in 1979.
