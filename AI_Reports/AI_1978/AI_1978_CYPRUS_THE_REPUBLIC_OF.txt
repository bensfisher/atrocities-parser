Cyprus (the Republic of)
Since the 1974 coup d'etat and the subsequent landing on the island of troops from the Turkish mainland, Amnesty International has been concerned about the fate of approximately 2,000 missing Greek-Cypriots. There is evidence that some of them were taken prisoner and were still alive after the cessation of hostilities. Inquiries about them were made in previous years (see the Amnesty International Reports for 1974/75 and 1975/76) but both the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot authorities have denied holding any Greek-Cypriot prisoners. Amnesty International takes the position that, until there is evidence that these people are dead, the possibility of their being prisoners cannot be discounted. The organization has, therefore, concentrated its inquiries on those cases where it has been established that the missing Greek-Cypriots were taken prisoner.
The possibility of an independent and impartial investigation into cases of missing Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots was raised by Amnesty International representatives during a meeting with the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, in April 1978; it was raised again with a Turkish-Cypriot spokesman, Husrev Siileyman, when the Amnesty International researcher responsible for the country visited Cyprus in May 1978. While both the Greek and Turkish authorities in Cyprus appear to be agreeable in principle to such an investigation, none has yet taken place because of failure to agree upon the terms under which it would operate.
On 5 May 1978, Amnesty International appealed to Spyros Kyprianou, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, to commute the death sentences passed on two Arabs, Samir Mohammad Khadar and Zayed Hussain Ali, who were sentenced to death in April 1978 for the murder in Cyprus of Youssef El Sabai, an Egyptian newspaper editor and friend of President Sadat of Egypt.
