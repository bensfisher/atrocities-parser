Algeria (the People's Democratic Republic of)
During the period covered by this report-July 1977-June 1978-Amnesty International adoption groups have continued to work for Ahmed Ben Bella, the former President of Algeria, who has been under strict house arrest since his overthrow in 1965. Following that coup, President Houari Boumedienne announced that a list of offences committed by Ahmed Ben Bella would be drawn up, and that he would be tried on the basis of this. The list was, however, never produced, and Ahmed Ben Bella remains in detention without charge or trial. In June 1978, to mark his thirteenth year in detention, Amnesty International launched a special appeal for his release.
Amnesty International believes that there are other prisoners of conscience in Algeria, but is unable to estimate their number because of lack of information.
In May 1978 Juan Antonio Alfonso Gonzalez, a Spanish citizen, was sentenced to death by the State Security Court in Algiers. He had been found guilty of the attempted assassination of Antonio Cubillo, leader of the Movement for the Autonomy and Independence of the Canary Archipelago (MPAIAC). Amnesty International wrote to the President and to the Minister of Justice, Abdul Malik Ben Habilis, expressing concern at the passing of this death sentence and adding
252
that it "in no way condones acts of violence . . . but respectfully requests that the death sentence passed on Mr Gonzalez be commuted on humanitarian grounds". At the time of writing it is not known whether the sentence has been commuted.
Algeria signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in December 1968, but has not yet ratified it. Amnesty International is concerned that information about its statutory concerns (see Appendix I) is not made public by the Algerian Government.
