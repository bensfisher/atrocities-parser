Brunei Darussalam
Amnesty International was concemed about the continued detention without trial of some 30 political prisoners, five of whom it had adopted as prisoners of conscience and for whose release it had appealed for many years. All five had been imprisoned for more than 22 years under Emergency Orders for their alleged involvement in an armed revolt in December 1962 led by the Partai Rakyat Brunei, Bmnei People's Party. The Sultanate had been mied under emergency laws since 1%2.
In February the government approved registration of a second political party, the Bmnei National United Party (BNUP), following the establishment of the Bmnei National Democratic Party (BNDP) the previous year which was then the Sultanate's sole legal political organization.
Ten previously unacknowledged political detainees most of whom had been held since the mid-1970s were released during 1986, after taking an oath of loyahy to the Sultan. This brought the total number of releases to 24 since Bmnei Damssalam became fully independent in January 1984.
Most of the prisoners about whom Amnesty International continued to be concemed were thought to have reached advanced years, and were believed to be held in virtual isolation. In October Amnesty International publicized their cases as "forgotten prisoners" when it appealed to the Suhan to release them, as it believed they continued to be held not for their involvement in the rebellion but as a general deterrent to political activity. No reasons were made public for the continued detention of these and other political prisoners.
