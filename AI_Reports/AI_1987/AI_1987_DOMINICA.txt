tional wrote to the Attorney General in June 1986 welcoming the news of the five commutations, but expressing its concern that clemency had not been extended to Frederick Newton. The news that the warrant for his execution had been prepared was made public only two days before the scheduled date of execution. Amnesty International appealed to the President for clemency, urging him to maintain Dominica's record of not executing prisoners under sentence of death. However, the execution took place as scheduled.
Amnesty International also appealed for clemency on behalf of Eric Joseph, a 33-year-old Rastafarian under sentence of death for the murder of a prominent landowner in 1981. His case came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom in 1986 but was dismissed in June because he could not afford to retain a lawyer to argue his case. He subsequently obtained legal representation and in November the Privy Council granted him leave to appeal to them.
There were believed to be six prisoners on death row at the end of 1986.
