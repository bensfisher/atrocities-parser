Amnesty International was concerned V	I	continued detention without
* trial of some 36 alleged opponents of the government, some of whom might have been prisoners of conscience. There were also new allegations of harsh prison conditions amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Amnesty International continued to investigate the cases of 36 people arrested on 1 August 1985 when security forces in the capital, Antananarivo, attacked buildings occupied by members of martial arts clubs suspected of opposing the government. Between 20 and 60 deaths were reported to have occurred as a result of the attacks and more than 200 people were detained, the majority of whom were released, however, within a few weeks. Although there was a history of violent clashes between members of martial arts clubs and members of a pro-government youth organization Tanora Tonga Saina, Youth Who Are Aware of Their Responsibilities, it appeared that some of those detained since August 1985 might have been held on account of their peaceful opposition to the government. Throughout 1986 Amnesty International pressed for them to be brought to trial or released, but none of the 36 detainees had been tried by the end of the year.
Amnesty International received new reports of harsh prison conditions. A high incidence of deaths among prisoners was reported to have occurred as a result of severe overcrowding, malnutrition and a lack of adequate medical facilities in the prisons.
