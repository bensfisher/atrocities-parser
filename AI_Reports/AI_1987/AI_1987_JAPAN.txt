Amnesty International was concerned about the use of the death penalty. It wrote to the govemment expressing concem about two executions. The names of the prisoners executed were not disclosed but Amnesty Intemational believed that they were Shigeharu Kimura and Reiichi Tokunaga, who had been convicted of murder and robbery in December 1975 in the same trial. They were reportedly executed on 20 May. Amnesty Intemational continued to urge the govemment to commute all death sentences. At the end of 1986, some 74 prisoners were known to be under sentence of death; they had all been convicted of murder, five of them of politically motivated murders. At least 23 had had their sentences upheld by the Supreme Court and eight had been under sentence of death for between 10 and 36 years. Several had filed appeals for retrial. On 30 May the Shizuoka District Court ordered the retrial of Masao Akahori who had been sentenced to death in May 1958. The court questioned the validity of his confession and other evidence against him.
