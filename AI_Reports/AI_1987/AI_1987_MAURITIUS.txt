Mauritius

Amnesty International was concerned about the extension of the death penalty. Article 38 of the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1986, which came into force on 12 September, introduced a mandatory death sentence for any person convicted of importing "dangerous drugs", which included opium, heroin, cannabis and coca leaves. Unlike other serious offences under Mauritian law, which are tried before a jury of nine citizens, the offence of importation under the Dangerous Drugs Act is heard by a judge without a jury.
In the course of the parliamentary debate on the Dangerous Drugs Bill, Sir Gaétan Duval, leader of the Parti mauricien sociale démocrate (PMSD), Mauritanian Social Democratic Party, who was also Minister of Justice, proposed a minimum 30-year sentence in place of the death sentence. However, this proposal was not accepted.
The death penalty was already in force in Mauritius for a number of offencès, principally murder, treason and mutiny. However, on the very rare occasions that courts have handed down death sentences, they have usually been commuted to lesser sentences. In 1984 a convicted murderer became the first f)erson to be executed in Mauritius since independence in 1968. No death sentences were reported to have been imposed under the new law. One person was reported to have been sentenced to death for murder in 1986. No executions were reported to have taken place.
