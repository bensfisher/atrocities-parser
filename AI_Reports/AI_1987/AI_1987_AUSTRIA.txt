During 1986 Amnesty International received allegations that people held in police custody during 1985 had been ill-treated. Amnesty International urged the authorities to investigate the allegations in two cases, those of Kurt Schwarz and Herbert Matejka, who both alleged that they had been beaten and given electric shocks. The authorities replied that an inquiry had established that Kurt Schwarz' claims were unfounded, but they gave no details of the investigation.

reply by the end of the year. The other prisoner, Herbert Matejka, escaped shortly after his arrest in August 1985 and fled to the Netherlands where he was rearrested. While in detention there he was examined by a psychiatrist who stated that Herbert Matejka's account of his treatment was coherent, that his emotions were consistent with such an experience and that there were no indications that his story was the result of delusions. The Austrian authorities replied to Amnesty Intemational saying that the times at which Herbert Matejka said he had been ill-treated were not consistent with their records, but they did not comment in detail on the substance of the allegations. Herbert Matejka was extradited to Austria but escaped again from custody on 24 September 1986.
