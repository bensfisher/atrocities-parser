Bahamas
Amnesty International was concerned about reports of Haitian illegal immigrants being detained in inhuman prison conditions in the Bahamas pending deportation procedures. According to the reports, some 49 children under the age of three were held with their mothers in one room in Fox Hill Prison, Nassau, following arrests in Bimini and Cat Cay on 20 February 1986. Many became ill but only once in the following two weeks did a doctor visit them. Most were deported to Haiti in mid-April. Another group of about 60 men were allegedly confined for over a week in an insect-infested room without bedding, beds or proper toilets. The room was so small that they had to take turns to sleep on the concrete floor. Drinking water was inadequate and contaminated, causing stomach disorders. Many of this group had been transported to

Nassau from Grand Bahama by ship and had allegedly been confined below deck during a sea journey of 13 hours without toilet facilities, seats or other amenities.
In July Amnesty International wrote to the Minister of National Security, calling on the government to institute a thorough, impartial inquiry into these reported conditions. The Minister had not replied by the end of 1986; however the Prime Minister, to whom a copy of the letter had been sent, replied briefly saying that the claims were "outrageous" and that Amnesty International should investigate further. Amnesty International wrote to the Prime Minister again in September, reiterating its request that the government conduct a full investigation. No further reply had been received by the end of 1986.
