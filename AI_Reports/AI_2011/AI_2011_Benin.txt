Freedom of expression and assembly

In October, the Ministry of Interior banned all demonstrations calling for information on the whereabouts of Pierre Urbain Dangnivo, a Ministry of Finance official who disappeared in August. Suspicions about the possible involvement of government officials in his disappearance provoked protests from the press, civil society and opposition political parties. An official inquiry failed to clarify his fate by the end of the year. Many civil society groups, including trade unions, denounced restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly.
