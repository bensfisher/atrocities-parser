Refugees and migrants

Following the earthquake in Haiti in January, the authorities announced that they would suspend the repatriation of Haitian migrants. However, soon afterwards, there were reports that Haitian migrants who landed in the Bahamas were being charged with illegal landing and repatriated. By the end of the year hundreds of Haitians had been repatriated.

At least five people were sentenced to death. Thirteen of those under sentence of death were awaiting retrials following a ruling in 2006 by the UK-based Judicial Committee of the Privy Council abolishing mandatory death sentences for murder. In December, the Bahamas voted against a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty.
