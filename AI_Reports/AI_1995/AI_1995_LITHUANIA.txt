LITHUANIA
Two people were executed and at least three others were under sentence of death.
Two people were executed after President Algirdas Brazauskas rejected their petitions for clemency. Vidmantas Zibaitis had been sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Lithuania in September 1993. Antanas Varnelis was sentenced to death by the same court at the beginning of the year. Both men had been found guihy of premeditated murder under aggravated circumstances. The executions by shooting took place in January and September respectively.
At the end of the year at least three other people were under sentence of death, including Boris Dekanidze who was convicted in November of ordering the assassination of a journalist the previous year. Both the other men under sentence of death were believed to have been denied the right to appeal against their convictions and sentences and were awaiting the outcome of petitions for clemency submitted to the President.
Throughout the year Amnesty International appealed to the authorities to commute all pending death sentences and to abolish the death penalty. The organization also asked the authorities in February to provide statistical information on the use of the death penalty. Amnesty International had received no reply to its request by the end of the year.
