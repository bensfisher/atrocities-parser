LUXEMBOURG
At least five prisoners were held in prolonged isolation.
The prisoners were kept in prolonged isolation in Schrassig prison for disciplinary reasons. In June Satko Adrovic completed a six-month period in solitary confinement as a punishment for attempting to escape. He had spent an even longer period in isolation the previous year for a similar offence (see Amnesty International Report 1994). Amnesty International believes that prolonged isolation may have serious effects on the physical and mental health of prisoners and may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
In April the government announced several changes to the practice of solitary confinement in response to criticisms made in 1993 by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (cpt), a body of experts set up under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (see Amnesty International Report 1994). The changes included employing instructors in Schrassig prison in order to organize stimulating activities for prisoners in isolation, and improving exercise facilities. The cpt's recommendation that the authorities should reconsider using solitary confinement as a punishment was rejected for "reasons connected with order and security".
In March Amnesty International asked the government what measures the prison authorities had taken to alleviate the physical and psychological effects of prolonged isolation on Satko Adrovic. No reply was received.
