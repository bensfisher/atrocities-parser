should have had their sentences commuted according to a November 1993 ruling by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (jcpc) in London, the final court of appeal for the Baheimas. The jcpc ruled that execution after more than five years on death row constitutes "inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment", and that such prisoners should have their sentences commuted. However, the government had taken no steps to commute the relevant sentences by the end of 1994.
The appeal of Anthony Neely and Jeremiah Poitier to the jcpc, challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty, was still awaiting a full hearing. They had argued that, as the method of execution was not specified in the Constitution or any specific law, execution would be unconstitutional.
In March Amnesty International urged the government to implement the November 1993 icpc decision and also called for the commutation of all death sentences.
