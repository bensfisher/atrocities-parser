There were a few reports of ill-treatment in custody, some relating to previous years.
Sergio Nigretti, an Italian national, alleged that he had been ill-treated while held in isolation at Kumla prison in 1993. The regional public prosecution authority, which conducted an investigation into the allegations, concluded that there were no grounds for further proceedings.
In June the Appeals Court confirmed the suspended sentences and fines levied against three prison guards found guilty of breach of duty regarding the death in custody in July 1993 of Tony Mutka (see Amnesty International Report 1994). Tony Mutka had died in custody while being transported from prison to hospital wearing only underpants, lying face-down on the floor between the front and back seats of a van, handcuffed behind the back and with his feet chained. Guards sitting in the back seat above him had placed their feet on Tony Mutka and shortly before he died a guard had stood on him. The Appeals

Court did not consider the guards' conduct to be a gross breach of duty. In November the Supreme Court denied the family's and the prison guards' requests for further review. Revised procedures for transporting prisoners in need of treatment came into force in January.
Amnesty International wrote to the government in March and April calling for Sergio Nigretti to be medically examined and treated, urging that his allegations be independently investigated, and requesting to be informed about the findings of the investigation. In September Amnesty International received from the authorities the findings of the investigation.
