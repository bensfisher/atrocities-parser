IRELAND
(REPUBLIC OF)
The death penalty was abolished in July: no execution had taken place since 1954. A former prisoner was prevented from raising his allegations of ill-treatment in custody in a civil action against the state.
Parliament passed a law abolishing the death penalty in lune; the law was signed by the President on 13 July and became effective immediately.
The High Court ruled in March that Osgur Breatnach could not raise his allegations of police assault in civil proceedings because of the criminal court's mling in 1978 that he had not been ill-treated. Osgur Breatnach, Nicky Kelly and Brian McNally had been convicted in 1978 of involvement in the 1976 Sallins mail train robbery solely on the basis of confessions allegedly obtained by ill-treatment during incommunicado detention. The Court of Criminal Appeal in 1980 mled that the confessions of Osgur Breatnach and Brian McNally had been involuntary and quashed their

sentences. Nicky Kelly was released on "humanitarian grounds" in 1984.
All three have attempted to bring civil actions for damages against the state (see Amnesty International Report 1990). Nicky Kelly was prevented from proceeding with his civil action in 1986; no decision has yet been reached on whether to allow Brian McNally's action.
Amnesty International was concerned that Osgur Breatnach and Nicky Kelly appeared to have been prevented from having their claims of police ill-treatment fully and impartially investigated. The organization urged the government to establish an independent inquiry into all the allegations of ill-treatment in custody made in connection with the 1976 Sallins mail train robbery, and to make the findings public.
