The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody continued its inquiries into deaths of Aboriginals in previous years. Prisoners in Yatala Labour Prison said that they had been denied food during a protest in January; the authorities denied the allegations.
No deaths said to have been caused by torture or ill-treatment, either in police or prison custody, were brought to the attention of Amnesty International during the year. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (see Amnesty Inter-
nationa! Reports 1989 and 1990] published reports on the deaths of Aboriginals in previous years, but did not find evidence that they resulted from police torture or ill-treatment. The Commission continued its inquiries and held a number of public hearings but had not issued its final report by the end of the year. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs wrote to Amnesty International in June. He stressed his government's commitment to the prevention of Aboriginal deaths in custody and mentioned several initiatives taken by states and territories to implement the recommendations contained in the Commission's interim report of 1989.
Amnesty International received reports that in January over 120 prisoners in the Yatala Labour Prison in South Australia were denied food for 72 hours as a punishment. In response to Amnesty International's inquiries and expression of concern, the state authorities denied the reports and said that food was available to the prisoners if they returned to their cells.
In October the federal government acceded to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty.
