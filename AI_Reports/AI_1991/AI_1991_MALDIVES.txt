MALDIVES
At least 10 journalists and a member of parliament were detained, apparently without charge or trial: they appeared to be prisoners of conscience. The death penalty was extended to additional crimes under new legislation.
In December the majlis (parliament) passed the Prevention of Terrorism Act which extended the death penalty to offences associated with terrorism. Full details of this legislation were not known ' by the end of the year.
At least 10 journalists and editors work-I ing for a news magazine, Sangu, and two
newspapers, Hukuru and Mantbiri, were arrested between June and the end of the year, apparently for having criticized the government during a period of greater freedom of expression following parliamentary elections in November 1989. It was not known how many remained in detention at the end of 1990. Sangu was ordered to close, and all copies of the first issue of Mantbiri were reportedly confiscated. In September an independent member of parliament, Mohammad Latheef, was also arrested. He had reportedly criticized corruption in government and called for a vote of no confidence. He remained in detention with no known charge against him at the end of the year.
Amnesty International expressed concern to the government about the arrests and urged that those held should be released if they had been detained for the peaceful expression of their opinions. Amnesty International also told the government in December of its concern about the extension of the death penalty and urged President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom to continue to commute death sentences, as had been the practice in the Maldives since 1951.
