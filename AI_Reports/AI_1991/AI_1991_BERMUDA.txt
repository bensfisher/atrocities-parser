One death sentence was imposed and later commuted. A referendum on capital punishment was held. There were no executions; the last hangings were carried out in 1977. No one was under sentence of death at the end of the year.
Leroy Dunlop was sentenced to death in January after being convicted of premeditated murder. He defended himself at his trial and chose not to exercise his right of appeal. He was scheduled to be executed on 21 February. However, on 16 February the Governor, Sir Desmond Langley, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment following consideration of the case by the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy.
The referendum on capital punishment approved by an Act of Parliament in June 1989 (see Amnesty International Report 1990) took place in August, Voters were asked whether they favoured retaining the death penalty for premeditated murder. Only about one third of registered voters participated in the ballot: some 79 per cent of them favoured retention. The result was not binding on Parliament and a parliamentary debate and vote were pending at the end of the year.
Amnesty International urged the Governor to exercise clemency in the case of Leroy Dunlop and later welcomed the commutation of his death sentence. The organization publicly called for the abolition of the death penalty in Bermuda before the referendum.
