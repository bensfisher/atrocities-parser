The government removed restrictions on the freedom of movement of six Kurdish refugees who had been under town arrest since 1984.
On 11 May the government ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Aiming at the Abolition of the Death Penalty.
Restrictions of town arrest had originally been imposed on nine Kurdish refugees whom the government considered to be terrorists. They could not be deported to Turkey because of fear of persecution (see Amnesty International Reports 1989 and 1990). Deportation orders and restrictions on two refugees were removed in August 1989 and restrictions on freedom of movement on six others in October 1990. However, the six refugees were still regarded as terrorists; they were required to report to the police weekly and their deportation orders remained in force. The ninth refugee, who was in prison for criminal offences, remained under restriction and deportation orders.
The government stated that the police believed that the Kurds' terrorist affiliations had become minor. In a hearing concerning two of the refugees in April, the Court of Appeal decided that the restrictions had "lasted so long that they must be considered as a deprivation of freedom" according to the Swedish Constitution. The judgment stated that the two refugees should be entitled to have their restrictions reviewed by a court. This decision was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court.

In an exchange of correspondence with the government during the year, Amnesty International reiterated its concern that the government's decision to place indefinite restrictions on the refugees' freedom of movement was not open to judicial scrutiny. In October the organization welcomed the lifting of restrictions on the six refugees.
