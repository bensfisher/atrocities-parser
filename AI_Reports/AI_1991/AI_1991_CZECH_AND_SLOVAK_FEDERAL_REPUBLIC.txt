June gave the Civic Forum party a majority in the Federal Assembly, and former prisoner of conscience Vaclav Havel was re-elected President. Throughout the year major reviews of the legal and political systems, including the Constitution, continued.
In March a civilian alternative to military service lasting 27 months was introduced. Normal military service is 18 months. There were no reports of people imprisoned for refusing conscription.
In May the Federal Parliament voted to abolish the death penalty and this became effective on 1 July. The last execution reportedly took place in February 1989.
In April Aleksandr Vitalyevich Maslyayev, a 19-year-old soldier with the Soviet army stationed in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (csfr), requested asylum at the Office of the President of the csfr on the grounds that he did not wish to perform his military service in an occupying army because of his conscientiously held beliefs. He was reportedly informed that his request would be processed by the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Instead, he was handed over to Soviet diplomatic staff and subsequently returned to his unit where he was reportedly detained for 10 days before being transferred to the ussr.
Amnesty International welcomed the abolition of the death penalty. In May the organization wrote to the government concerning the introduction of alternative service. In August it raised its concerns regarding the return of Aleksandr Maslyayev.
