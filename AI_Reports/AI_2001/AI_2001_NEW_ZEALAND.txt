In July the Court of Appeal overturned an earlier High Court decision which in 1999 had led to the release from prison of 16 asylum-seekers. The New Zealand Immigration Service had argued that the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Guidelines on the Detention of Asylum-Seekers imposed no obligations on government officials to release detained asylum-seekers.
