In August the government submitted to parliament a proposal to amend the Constitution. The proposed
amendments included extending the term of office of the president from five to seven years and of parliament from four to six years. The government also proposed the establishment of a consultative council (Majlis al-Shura) of ni members appointed by the president. The proposed amendments were approved by the parliament in November and were expected to be the subject of a referendum in early 2001.
In al-Dala' two people, a soldier and a child, were reportedly killed in February and May respectively. The killings occurred amid ongoing tensions and protests calling for the demilitarization of the area, the integration of former South Yemeni soldiers into the army, and the release of detainees.
Scores of people were reportedly killed in clashes between armed tribes, and between tribes and the security forces in different parts of the country. In July and August, 39 people were reportedly killed during clashes between the Wallah and Dalim tribes near the border with Saudi Arabia. At least three people, including a child, were killed in July during clashes between the Al Zayidi tribe and the military in Mareb governorate. The clashes followed the kidnapping of military officers by tribesmen. Scores of residents fled their homes, reportedly after the area was bombarded by the Yemeni army. The village of Misrakh, in Ta'iz governorate, was also reportedly shelled by the Yemeni army in July following clashes between residents and army units arising from a land dispute. Confrontations with the military also occurred in Kud Qru, near Aden, in September, after local people prevented a contractor from digging stones from a mountain, the ownership of which was claimed by the Kud Qru tribe. More than 200 people were reported to have fled the area in fear of their lives. Reports suggested that some people may have died as a result of excessive use of force by members of the security forces.
In October, 17 US sailors were killed and 35 wounded when a bomb exploded on a US destroyer in the port of Aden. Around 100 people were detained by the Yemeni authorities for questioning; most were released after a brief period in detention. Members of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) travelled to Yemen to take part in the investigation but it was not known whether they were involved in the interrogation of the detainees. No information was available as to how many people remained held by the end of the year.
A total of 17 people were reported to have been abducted by tribesmen in seven incidents. In most cases the abductors demanded that the government improve local services and amenities.
Political prisoners and prisoners of conscience
Hundreds of people were arrested and detained on political grounds in different parts of the country but particularly in the southern regions. Some arrests took place after clashes with the security forces, others after what appeared to have been peaceful protests against government policies.
