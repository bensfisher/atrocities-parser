Legislation to establish a parliamentary commission on human rights was presented to the National Assembly. Proposals included the monitoring of Guyana's compliance with international human rights treaties, and initiatives for human rights education.
Police shootings
Frequent reports were received of killings by police in circumstances suggesting that they were extrajudicial executions. In June, members of the PNC/R submitted a parliamentary motion calling on the President to establish an inquiry into the police force. Q Shazad Bacchus, aged 15, Azad Bacchus and Faddil Ally, aged 18, were beaten and shot by members of the Berbice Anti-Smuggling Squad (BASS) in circumstances suggesting extrajudicial execution. According to relatives, Shazad Bacchus was arrested and beaten by BASS officials at his uncle's home before being taken to hospital with injuries to his face and body. BASS officials are alleged to have opened fire on a minibus the three were travelling in as they left the hospital. Witnesses alleged that the three were subsequently dragged from the bus and killed. The Minister for Home Affairs stated that an investigation into the killings would be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The findings had not been released by the end of the year.
In August Saif Ghani and Steven Angel were shot dead and four others were injured after police opened fire on an estimated 400 people who were protesting against the killings at the BASS headquarters.
