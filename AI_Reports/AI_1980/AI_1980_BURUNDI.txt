Burundi
Renewed tension between the majority Hutu and ruling minority Tutsi ethnic groups resulted in the arrest, in May 1979, of a number of leading Hutu. It is reported that they included school and university teachers, students and minor officials. Some leading members of the Hutu community were alleged to have been secretly detained or killed, but the accuracy of these reports could not be confirmed. The government of President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza denied that there had been any arrests or killings and maintained that it was holding no political prisoners.
After international publicity about the events, the government invited Amnesty International to visit Burundi to confirm that no Hutu had been arrested or killed. Amnesty International asked for further details about this invitation and two months later, in August 1979, was informed that although there were no political prisoners, the govemmènt was ready to collaborate. However, a further inquiry by Amnesty International about two prisoners arrested iri September 1978 remained unanswered. They were the former Minister of the Interior, Gabriel Ndikumana and a student, Philippe Ngendakumana, who was held with several others, apparently for opposing the government's policies towards the Hutu community. Both Gabriel Ndikumana and Philippe Ngendakumana are members of the Tutsi ethnic group.
In early December 1979 Amnesty International learned of the arrest of five people accused of "violent verbal propaganda" shortly before the congress of the Union pour le progrès niïizortû/(UPRONA), the Unity and Progress Party. Four were released at the end of December under an amnesty which benefitted most convicted prisoners but it is not known what happened to the fifth person or whether the amnesty was extended to other untried political prisoners such as Gabriel Ndikumana and Philippe Ngendakumaila.
