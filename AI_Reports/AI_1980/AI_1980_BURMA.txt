During the year Amnesty Intemational received reports of the imprisonment and torture of both actual and alleged members of the opposition. Throughout the period under review, Ne Win continued to hold the key positions of Head of State and Chairman of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party, the only officially recognized political party in Burma. A number of changes in the government and the military occurred but, unlike those of previous years, these changes did not result in the arrest or trial of any of those removed from office during the course of events.
The government severely restricts access to the country by outside observers and the press is strictly controlled. However, during the year Amnesty International received several allegations of imprisonment and torture, all of which were being investigated. It was also reported that some of those arrested for alleged involvement in the demonstrations that occurred after the funeral in Rangoon in December 1974 of the Burmese former United Nations Secretary-General U Thant were still in detention. Penalties for individuals expressing opinions critical of the administration appeared to be harsh: Amnesty Intemational received information concerning the trial in November 1978 of a man accused of having in his possession books of poetry deemed by the authorities to defame the.Republic; he was sentenced to life imprisonment Amnesty International also received several reports of the torture of two brothers belonging to the Karen tribal minority. Amnesty International was investigating these and other allegations of human rights violations which fall within its mandate.
