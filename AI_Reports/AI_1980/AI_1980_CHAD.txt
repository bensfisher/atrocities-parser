Chad
Amnesty International is concerned about reports of serious human rights violations affecting prisoners taken by different political groupings in Chad It has received information about summary executions and disappearances but has not been able to verify or document individual cases. Its work on behalf of victims of human rights violations has been impeded by the general breakdown of administration.
Events continued to be dominated by the protracted power struggle between the Front de libération nationale du Tchad (FROLINAT), Chad National Liberation Front, headed by Goukouni Oueddei, and the Forces armées du Nord (FAN), Armed Forces of the North, led by Hissène Habré. For a time these and other factions were brought together in an uneasy coalition under the terms of a settlement agreed by the rival organizations in August 1979, at a meeting convened in Lagos, under the auspices of the Nigerian Government. Asa result of the agreement, a transitional government of national unity was formed with Goukouni Oueddei as executive President. Hissène Habré was given the important post of Defence Minister, and Wadal Abdoulkader Kamougue, the acknowledged political leader of the country's southern population, became Vice-President.
The agreement signed in August, like an earlier agreement reached in March 1979, stipulated that each of the factions should release its political prisoners and other prisoners taken during the course of the conflict. It is uncertain how many prisoners were released. Soldiers from the south, for example, who were held at Faya Largeau in Chad's northern region, were not released by FROLINAT.

All parties to the August agreeftient also undertook to withdraw their military forces from the capital, N'Djamena, but again this condition was not observed. Further serious fighting broke out between FROLINAT and FAN in March 1980 and more than one thousand people were believed to have been killed by the end of April.
