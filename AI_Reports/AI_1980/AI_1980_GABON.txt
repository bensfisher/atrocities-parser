During the year Amnesty International was concerned about the imprisonment of prisoners of conscience and about the death penalty.
In January 1980 President Omar Bongo granted an amnesty to mark his re-election for a second term as head of state. Those released included at least 10 political prisoners, whose sentences were reduced. One of those freed, Alexis Koumba-Mopangou, had reportedly been imprisoned continuously for 21 years, and was said to have been convicted and sentenced to a total of 90 years' imprisonment in 1958.
Amnesty International adopted as prisoners of conscience two long-term detainees who did not benefit from the amnesty. Dominique Diata and Augustin Irigo, both soldiers by profession, have been held without trial since March 1978, when they were arrested on suspicion of left-wing sympathies. At the beginning of 1980, they were reportedly held incommunicado at Libreville prison. According to the government, they have not been tried because the case against them is still in preparation, even though they have now been held for more than two years.
Public executions were carried out for the first time in July 1979 when two convicted murderers were shot by firing squad on a beach at Libreville. The executions were attended by a large crowd and were broadcast on the local television service. Amnesty International wrote to President Bongo deploring these executions and requesting him to take steps to abolish the death penalty.
