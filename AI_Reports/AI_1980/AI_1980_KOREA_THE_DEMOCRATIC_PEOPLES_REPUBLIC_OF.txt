Korea
(the Democratic People's Republic of)
Although the country's 1972 constitution enumerates many rights, including freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly and association, and specifies safeguards for criminal accused. Amnesty International cannot substantiate that the protections guaranteed by the constitution apply to people charged with political offences. The constitution
207
requires the courts to act independently of political authority. An official statement by Marshall (now President) Kim II Sung in 1958 indicated that in practice they were not in a position to do this.
The government maintains severe restrictions on access to, travel in, and dissemination of information in, the country. It therefore continues to be very difficult to collect information on human rights concerns within Amnesty International's mandate.
The only detailed account of political imprisonment in North Korea received by Amnesty International to date remains that of the former prisoner, Venezuelan poet Ali Lameda, who was held in Suriwon prison camp until his release in 1974. In testimony to Amnesty International he reported ill-treatment, severe prison conditions and a large prison population. Amnesty International is, however, not able to corroborate the account of this single prisoner.
The total number of political prisoners in North Korea is not known, although their existence has been officially acknowledged in 1978 at the time of an amnesty for "those who committed crimes against the state".
