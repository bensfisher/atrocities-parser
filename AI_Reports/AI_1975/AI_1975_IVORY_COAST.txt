IVORY COAST
In July 1975 Amnesty International Deputy Secretary General Hans Ehrenstrâle visited the Ivory Coast as a further stage in the AI campaign, launched in March 1975, for a general amnesty for political prisoners. He was granted a two-hour audience with President Félix Houphoiiet-Boigny and also met Lucien Yaboby, Vice-President of the High Court. During the discussions the principal topic was the situation of the 85 prisoners sentenced to prison terms ranging from 5 years to life in August 1974 for their part in an uprising in the Gagnoa district of the country's southwestern region in October 1970.
On 13 October 1975 President Houphoiiet-Boigny, as a prelude to the sixth congress of the ruling Parti Démocratique de la Côte d'Ivoire (PDCI), announced a general amnesty covering 5,000 prisoners. These were mostly criminals, but included the 85 persons sentenced in August 1974. All AI adoptees in the Ivory Coast were released as a result of the amnesty, which also commuted the death sentences passed on 13 officers involved in an abortive plot in July 1973. Twelve of the officers were released and pardoned, but a 13th, the alleged ringleader, had his sentence commuted to imprisonment. On 15 October 1975 AI wrote a letter to the President congratulating him on the amnesty.
