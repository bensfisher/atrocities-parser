GRENADA
On 11 June 1975 Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister Eric Gairy of Grenada expressing the hope that all charges against members of the opposition New Jewel Movement would be dropped. This was in the light of the report of the Duffus Commission of Inquiry into the breakdown of law and order and police brutality in Grenada. As AI stated in the letter: It is made quite clear by the report that these men were subjected to deliberate harrassment and persecution by the police and that any police evidence against them must be regarded with suspicion ... the commission completely demolishes the police case against members of the New Jewel Movement, and I urge you to use all your influence to have any proceedings against these men dismissed. AI has no adopted prisoners in Grenada.
