SWAZILAND
Dr Ambrose Zwane, leader of the Ngwane National Liberatory Congress (NNLC), Swaziland's main opposition party, was detained on 29 October 1975 after the publication of an article he had written for a South African newspaper concerning Swaziland's foreign policy. As on previous occasions -he was similarly detained in 1973 and 1974 - no charges were brought against Dr Zwane and he was released after 60 days, the maximum period for which a person can be detained without charge under Swazi law.
Amnesty International cabled a protest to the Swaziland government over Dr Zwane's detention.
AI has also been concerned throughout the year with the situation of Phenias Nene, a supporter of the NNLC, who is detained as a prohibited immigrant. Mr Nene is a political refugee from South Africa, but it is his association with the NNLC rather than his nationality which seems to have led to his detention
The vulnerability of political refugees in Swaziland was vividly demon strated in March 1976 when Cleophas Ndlovu and Joseph Nduli were reportedly abducted from the country by South African security agents. Both men subsequently appeared in court in South Africa charged with political offences (see section on South Africa).
