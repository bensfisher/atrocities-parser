MOZAMBIQUE
Following a mission to Mozambique in early June 1975, Amnesty International appealed to President Samora Machel to declare a general amnesty on 25 June 1975, Mozambique independence day.
The new FRELIMO (Front for the Liberation of Mozambique) government did not grant the amnesty, however, and the International Secretariat received reports of further detentions throughout the year. People detained include former members of FRELIMO, a number of Portuguese and South African citizens resident in Mozambique and many Jehovah's Witnesses and religious j dissidents. The Research Department is presently considering taking up some of these cases.
Further arrests are believed to have been made following an unsuccessful mutiny of FRELIMO soldiers in December.
A number of Portuguese nationals who were freed from detention and deported following the visit of a Portuguese government delegation to the j capital Maputo (formerly Lourengo Marques) in January, alleged that they had been subjected to torture and maltreatment while in detention.
A group of Rhodesian railway workers detained when Mozambique closed its border with Rhodesia on 3 March 1976 were freed in April 1976.
In October 1975, the Mozambique government created its own secret police force, the National Service for Popular Security, under the direct control of the President. Designed to counter all forms of internal subversion, the new security organization was given powers of indefinite detention without trial.
