BOTSWANA
Amnesty International's principal concern in Botswana in 1975-76, as in previous years, was the situation of political refugees from surrounding countries who have sought asylum there. The number of such refugees continued to grow throughout the year. This was the result of continuing repression in Rhodesia and government action against supporters of the South West Africa People's Organization in Namibia and of the "black consciousness" movement in South Africa.
The International Secretariat has been in contact with both the Botswana government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees concerning the status and security against repatriation afforded to all political refugees, particularly those who were formerly imprisoned or detained in their home country.
