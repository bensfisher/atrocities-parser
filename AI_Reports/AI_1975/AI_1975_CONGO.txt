CONGO
On 31 July 1975 President Marien Ngouabi of Congo announced that his government intended to lift all restrictions on former political prisoners who,

since a previous general amnesty in November 1973, had been under house arrest or working with "production brigades". The announcement was followed on 9 August 1975 by the freeing from restrictions of 70 former prisoners under decrees signed by Congolese Prime Minister Henri Lopes. Among those released were the former commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Félix Mouazabakani, and former Prime Minister Ambroise Noumazalayi.
In January 1976 Amnesty International Deputy Secretary General Hans Ehrenstrâle visited Congo as part of a tour of West African states. He had an audience with President Ngouabi, during which human rights topics were discussed. The President expressed his willingness to receive a more extensive AI mission at a future date.
In March 1976, following a call for a general strike by the leaders of the Congolese Labour Confederation (CSC), a wave of arrests took place in trade union circles. Those detained included Kondho Anatole, the secretary general of the CSC, and his deputy. At the time of writing AI had received no indication that these prisoners had been tried or released.
