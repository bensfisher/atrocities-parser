MALI
During July 1975 Amnesty International Deputy Secretary General Hans Ehrenstrale visited Mali as a follow up to the concerted campaign for a general amnesty in Mali which had been launched by AI adoption and coordination groups in November 1974. Mr Ehrenstrale met President Moussa Traore, who in December 1974 had pledged that political detainees would be released during 1975. He also met Lieutenant Colonel Filifing Sissoko, Permanent Secretary to the ruling Military Committee for National Liberation.
During the discussions, attention was focused on the situation of two groups of prisoners: members of the former government of President Modibo Keita, who had been held without charge or trial since 1968, and 14 other persons arrested in June 1974 and sentenced to prison terms in April 1975 for criticizing a constitutional referendum organized by the Military Committee for National Liberation.
On 19 November 1975, six of the members of the former" government were eleased from detention. At the time of writing AI groups were handling a otal of 30 adoption cases and one investigation case in Mali, and AI was continuing its call for a general amnesty.
