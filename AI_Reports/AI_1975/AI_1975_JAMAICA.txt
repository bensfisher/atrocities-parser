JAMAICA
Mario Hector, Eaton Baker and Paul Tyrell, the three young men referred to in last year's annual report, who were sentenced to death for crimes committed when they were under 18 years of age, have all had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment. But another similar case was brought to the attention of Amnesty International during the year. On 1 April 1976 AI wrote to Governor General Florizel Glasspole, appealing for the reprieve of Lloyd Cordwell, who had been sentenced to death for a crime committed when he was 17 years old. On 20 April the Governor General replied that new legislation now prevents the death sentence being carried out in all cases where the offender was under 18 years old when the offence was committed.
AI has no adopted prisoners in Jamaica.
