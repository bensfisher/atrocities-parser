CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
On 3 February 1976 President Jean-Bedel Bokassa escaped an assassination attempt at Bangui airport. Later in the month eight persons were sentenced to death for their alleged part in the attempt. Two other defendants were given 20-year prison terms, three 10 years and one 3 years. One defendant was acquitted and it was announced that another 15 persons would be tried at a later date. Amnesty International is at present assembling information on these cases.
AI groups continued to handle as adoption cases the secretary general of the Union Générale des Travailleurs Centrafricains, Jean-Richard Sandos, and his deputy, J. B. Malikanga, both initially arrested in January 1974. Mr Sandos was released in August 1974 but re-arrested in January 1975.
The total number of political prisoners held in the Central African Republic is unknown, but believed high. Difficulty in obtaining information on individual prisoners has precluded a more extentive program of adoption work.
