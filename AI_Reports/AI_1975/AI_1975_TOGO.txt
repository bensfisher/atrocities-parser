TOGO
Amnesty International groups continue to handle the cases of two Togolese prisoners, one of whom, Frank Tsogbe, has been detained without charge or trial since 1973. Both are held in the civil prison in the capital, Lom√©. Although about 20 persons are believed held without trial in Togo for political reasons, insufficient data on individual prisoners has precluded a major adoption program.
