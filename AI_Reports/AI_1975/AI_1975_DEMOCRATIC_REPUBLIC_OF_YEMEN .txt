DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM
Amnesty International groups continue to work for a small number of adopted prisoners in North Vietnam. These include members of a music band who were tried by the Hanoi People's Tribunal in January 1971, on charges of spreading "imperialistic culture and counter-revolutionary propaganda". They were sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from several months to 15 years. One of them was due for release in January 1976, but inquiries made by the AI group working on his case have remained unanswered.
Other adopted cases concerned two members of the so-called Nhan-Van Giai-Pham group of artists and writers (named after two reviews called Nhan-Van and Giai-Pham) who were arrested in 1957-58. Both were given a 15-year sentence in January 1960 on charges of "espionage and anti-revolutionary activities". One of these two cases is Mrs Luu Thi Yen, known under the pen name of Thuy-An. In June 1975, AI learned from a private source that Mrs Luu Thi Yen had been released in 1974. However, her present status is not known and no official confirmation of the release has yet been received.
All attempts made by AI groups and by the International Secretariat to discuss these cases with North Vietnamese representatives have so far been unsuccessful.
