Since the amnesty for political prisoners announced in April 1975, Amnesty International has been seeking confirmation of the release of 44 adopted prisoners and of other political prisoners. (AT had collected the names of over 200 persons reported to have been imprisoned for political reasons.) So far the release of only six adopted prisoners has been confirmed.
