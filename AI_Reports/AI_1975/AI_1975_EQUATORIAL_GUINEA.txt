EQUATORIAL GUINEA
Reports reaching Amnesty International concerning Equatorial Guinea continue to indicate that the former Spanish colony, now ruled as a dictatorship by President Macias Nguema, is one of the most repressive and totalitarian states in Africa. Amongst those reported arrested between April and July 1975 were the Vice-President and Minister of the Interior, Miguel Eyegue, one of the President's top military advisers, Captain Salvador Ela, and between 15 and 20 Roman Catholic priests and nuns, largely in the country's mainland province of Rio Muni.
In November 1975 Nigerian migrant workers, who formed the main labour force on the island's cocoa plantations, began to withdraw because of harassment and brutality. By mid-February 1976 about 50,000 of the estimated 60,000 Nigerian workers had left the country, bringing reports of torture and indiscriminate imprisonment. A mass repatriation of Nigerians was ordered by the Nigerian government in January 1976 after 11 Nigerian workers were killed by soldiers in the Equatorial Guinean capital, Malabo.
Reports from exile sources in February 1976 indicated that citizens of Equatorial Guinea were being rounded up and forced to labour on the cocoa plantations in the place of the departed Nigerians.
