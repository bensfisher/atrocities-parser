CAMEROUN
During July 1975 Amnesty International Deputy Secretary General Hans Ehrenstr^le visited Cameroun to further AI's campaign in December 1974 for a general amnesty for political prisoners in that country. An amnesty in May 1975 had in fact released 50 political detainees, including Monsignor Albert Ndongmo, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nkongsamba, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.
During his mission Mr Ehrenstrale was able to discuss human rights problems with Minister of Justice Charles Doumba. AI was able to confirm the release of three adopted prisoners during 1975. AI groups continue to handle five cases of persons believed still to be in detention.
