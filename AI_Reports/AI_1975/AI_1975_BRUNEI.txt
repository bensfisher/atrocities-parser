1974, when the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah Muizzaddin Waddaulah, announced the setting up of a special advisory committee to review the cases of the detainees, a total of 23 of 49 adopted prisoners have been released. All the released prisoners have taken oaths of loyalty to the Sultan and to the government of Brunei.
Most of the 26 men have been held without trial for over 12 years. They are members of the Partai Rakyat (People's Party) who were detained following the suppression of a revolt organized by the Partai Rakyat in December 1962. They have never been brought to trial, and they are held under emergency orders which have been in force since 1962.
Individual AI groups continue to write to the Sultan welcoming the releases as they take place. They also urge the release of the men who remain in detention.
