GABON
A number of Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned for short periods on account of their religious beliefs and there were some reports of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners.
Twenty-four members of the Jehovah's Witnesses sect, which was banned in Gabon in 1970. were brought to trial in January. They had been arrested at a prayer meeting in Port-Gentil on 25 December 1986. They were convicted of belonging to a banned organization: three were sentenced to two months' imprisonment and a fine, and the other 21 received suspended sentences.
There were reports that a number of criminal suspects and alleged illegal immigrants were tortured and beaten at the headquarters in Libreville of the national security service, the Centre de documentation (CEDOC), Documentation Centre. It was also said that conditions there were harsh, with poor hygiene, inadequate medical facilities and insufficient food.
Amnesty International appealed for the release of the imprisoned Jehovah's Witnesses and expressed concern to the authorities about reports of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners at the CEDOC detention centre.
