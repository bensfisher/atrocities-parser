At least 17 deaths in custody of aboriginals were reported during 1987. The high incidence of deaths in custody of aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders since 1980 resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry.
Prime Minister Bob Hawke announced in August the establishment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry to investigate the incidence of deaths in custody of aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, which have been disproportionately high this decade in relation to the rest of the population. In most cases coroners have attributed the deaths of individual aboriginal prisoners

to natural causes or suicide. Many deceased prisoners' families, however, have questioned the impartiality and thoroughness of official inquests and investigations and suggested that some deaths might have been the result of ill-treatment.
The Royal Commission, which was headed by a Federal Court judge, began its hearings in November and said it would investigate at least 64 deaths in custody since 1980,17 of them between the beginning of 1987 and mid-November.
Amnesty International wrote to the Prime Minister in August to welcome the establishment of the Royal Commission. The government replied in September, saying that ministers for justice in the Australian states were considering a draft code of procedures to prevent further deaths of aboriginal prisoners.
