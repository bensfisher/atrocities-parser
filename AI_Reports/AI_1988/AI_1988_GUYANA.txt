Some 30 prisoners were believed to be under sentence of death but there were no executions in 1987. The government ordered an inquiry into the death in 1980 of an opposition leader who was alleged to have been the victim of an extrajudicial execution. However, the inquest had not begun by the end of the year.

The inquest was ordered in October into the death of Dr Waher Rodney, leader of the Working People's Alliance (WPA), who was killed by a bomb in June 1980. His brother. Donald Rodney, who was with him in a car at the time of the explosion, alleged that the bomb had been concealed in a walkie-talkie given to him by a member of the Guyana Defence Force, who later left the country. The government alleged that Dr Rodney intended to use the bomb to blow up Georgetown prison. The WPA contended that the government was responsible for planting the bomb. In early 1987 the former soldier claimed in a number of press interviews from neighbouring French Guiana that Dr Rodney's death had been an "accident". Following this, in April, Amnesty International reiterated earlier requests to the government to reopen its inquiry into Dr Rodney's death in view of the reappearance of someone who appeared to be a key witness.
