BARBADOS
Some 14 prisoners were under sentence of death in 1987, two of whom were minors (aged under 18) at the time of the crime. Under Barbadian law the minimum age for the imposition of the death penalty is 16. No executions were carried out during the year.
The two juvenile offenders, Michael Taylor and Patrick Greaves, were sentenced to death in 1984 for a murder committed during a robbery when they were aged 17. The Court of Appeal upheld their death sentences in November 1986.
Barbados is one of only six countries known since 1980 to have executed people who were minors at the time of the commission of the crime. In 1982 Martin Marsh was executed for a crime committed in May 1980 when he was aged 16. The Barbados Bar Association called on the government in September 1987 to review existing legislation so as to ensure that the death penalty could not be imposed on minors.
Amnesty International wrote to the government in December 1986 urging it to bring Barbadian law into line with international standards that prohibit the imposition of the death penalty on persons aged under 18 at the time of the crime. It also asked the government to commute Patrick Greaves' and Michael Taylor's death sentences. In its reply in February 1987, the government noted Amnesty International's concerns and said they would be given due consideration at the appropriate time.
