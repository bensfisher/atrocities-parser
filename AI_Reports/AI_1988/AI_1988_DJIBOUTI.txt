DJIBOUTI
Several recognized refugees and asylum-seekers were forcibly returned to their countries of origin, although in cases known to Amnesty International the individuals evaded arrest in the countries to which they were returned and re-entered Djibouti.
In May six Somali students who were seeking asylum were arrested by the Djibouti authorities and taken to the Somali border. However, they succeeded in

escaping back to Djibouti, where they reapplied for asylum.
Seven Ethiopian refugees who had been granted asylum in Djibouti were arrested in June and forcibly returned to Ethiopia. This incident followed a demonstration in Djibouti by people whose asylum applications had been rejected. In all, 103 Ethiopians were rounded up after the demonstration. Some of them were beaten and all were then forced into a sealed train which took them to the Ethiopian border. At the border they were handed over to the Ethiopian authorities. The seven Ethiopians who were recognized refugees escaped and returned to Djibouti, where their refugee status was subsequently respected. There was an unconfirmed report that one of the others expelled to Ethiopia, a former army lieutenant, was imprisoned by the Ethiopian authorities.
There were allegations that other asylum applicants resident in Djibouti, some from Ethiopia and some from Somalia, were forcibly returned to their countries of origin following mass arrests of suspected illegal immigrants.
Amnesty International investigated allegations of forcible return but was not able to obtain sufficient details to confirm that those returned were, in fact, asylum-seekers or that they risked unjust imprisonment, torture or execution if returned to their country of origin.
