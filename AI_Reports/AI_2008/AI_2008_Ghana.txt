The government continued paying reparations to victims of human rights violations under previous governments. The government commuted at least 43 death sentences and granted amnesty to 1,815 prisoners during the year. Although the Domestic Violence Act became law, violence and discrimination against women remained prevalent.
Death penalty

No executions were carried out and no death sentences were handed down. The government was reported to have said that the death penalty has no deterrent effect, but no concrete steps were taken towards abolition during 2007.
In March, 36 death row inmates had their sentences commuted as part of the 50th anniversary of Ghana’s independence. In June, President John Kufuor commuted seven death sentences to life imprisonment to commemorate the 47th anniversary of Ghana’s republican status. According to the Ghanaian Prisons Service, there were 106 prisoners on death row, including three women and 16 prisoners over the age of 60.
Violence against women

Women continued to be victims of domestic violence and female genital mutilation. The Domestic Violence and Victims Support Units established in the police service remained under-resourced.
The Domestic Violence Act became law, allowing prosecution of marital rape. A plan of action for its implementation was drafted.
Forced evictions

Forced evictions and internal displacement, particularly of marginalized people, remained a threat and continued to occur.
National Reconciliation Commission

The government continued to pay some financial reparations for human rights abuses under former governments, in accordance with the recommendations of the National Reconciliation Commission.
