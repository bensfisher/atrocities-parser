KYRGYZSTAN
At least 30 executions were believed to have taken place.
Elections to a new bicameral parliament were held in February. In September parliament rejected a proposal to hold a referendum on extending President Askar Akayev's term in office until the year 2001, although he won a second term in office in presidential elections held in December.
Kyrgyzstan acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in January.
In May President Akayev refused clemency petitions from 30 prisoners under sentence of death. Although only one execution was subsequently confirmed, it was believed that all 30 sentences were carried out in the following months.
Amnesty International called for the commutation of all death sentences and continued to urge total abolition of the death penalty.
