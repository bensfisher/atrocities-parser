LITHUANIA
Two people were executed. Four death sentences were conunuted and five people remained under sentence of death.
In June Lithuania ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fimdamental Freedoms, which it had signed in May 1993. In September it signed the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
In February the Supreme Court ruled that there were no groimds for reviewing the death sentence passed on Boris De-kanidze, who had been convicted in November 1994 of ordering the assassination of a journalist (see Amnesty International Report 1995). He was executed in July, following rejection of his petition for clemency by President Algirdas Brazauskas. Earlier in the year the Lithuanian Clemency Commission, headed by the President, had for the first time commuted a death sentence to life imprisonment.
Throughout the year Amnesty International appealed to the Lithuanian authorities to commute all pending death sentences and to abolish the death penalty. In March the organization expressed concern to the Lithuanian authorities that their failure to carry out a full review of the death sentence passed on Boris Dekanidze may have amounted to a breach of Article 14(5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Republic of Lithuania is a party. In November Amnesty International asked the authorities for clarification of the number of prisoners currently under sentence of death and for information on whether appeals had been heard against
the sentences passed. In December the organization was informed that "within the period of six months of 1995" a total of eight death sentences had been passed. Three had been reduced to life imprisonment on appeal; the other five were still pending.
