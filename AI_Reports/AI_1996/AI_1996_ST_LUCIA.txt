The first execution since April 1986 took place when Joseph Solomon, sentenced to death for murder in 1994, was hanged on 17 October. An earlier death sentence imposed on Joseph Solomon for rape and murder in 1979 had been commuted and he was released from prison in 1993 after serving 14 years of a life sentence. The Attorney General issued a public statement after the execution, expressing the view that the resumption of hangings would have a deterrent effect on crime.
No new death sentences were imposed. Eight prisoners, all convicted of murder, remained under sentence of death.
Amnesty International wrote to the Saint Lucia authorities in October expressing deep regret at the execution of Joseph Solomon. It xirged the government to commute the death sentences of those remaining on death row and to take steps to abolish the death penalty.
