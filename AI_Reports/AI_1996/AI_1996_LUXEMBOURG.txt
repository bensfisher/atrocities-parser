At least three prisoners were kept in prolonged isolation in Schrassig prison for disciplinary reasons. In June Carlo Fett was placed in solitary confinement for six months. He had escaped from the prison the previous month and had stabbed the officer who recaptured him. Amnesty International believes that prolonged isolation may have serious effects on the physical and mental health of prisoners and may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
In September Amnesty International asked the Luxembourg authorities what measures the prison authorities had taken to alleviate the physical and psychological effects of prolonged isolation on Carlo Fett and other prisoners in Schrassig. In particular, the organization asked for information on the number of instructors recruited during the year to organize stimulating activities for prisoners in isolation, one of the reforms announced by the Luxembourg authorities in April 1994 in response to criticisms made by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, a body of experts set up under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (see Amnesty

In November the Minister of Justice informed Amnesty International that "the place and the form of the daily exercise period" of prisoners in solitary confinement had been changed. Furthermore, in October a competitive examination had been held to recruit instructors to work with prisoners in solitary confinement. However, no candidates had entered the exam. Finally, in the case of one prisoner the period of solitary confinement had been reduced.
