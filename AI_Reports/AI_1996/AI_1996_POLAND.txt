POLAND
Three people were sentenced to death.
The Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly continued to work throughout the year on a new constitution. There was criticism from President Lech Walesa of proposals to reduce presidential powers and from the Catholic Church because the proposed draft did not refer to Catholic precepts and values.
In July the government approved a draft law abolishing the death penalty and introduced life imprisonment. In November a five-year moratorium on the death penalty came into force.
During the year suspected perpetrators of past human rights abuses were brought to trial. In April General Wojciech Jaruzelski and 11 other former senior communist officials were indicted for the killings of. 44 protesting workers in Gd√§nsk and Gdynia in 1970. In May, two former police officers went on trial in Warsaw for the killing of Grzegorz Przemyk, a 19-year-old high school student, in 1983 (see Amnesty Internationa! Report 1984). Another officer in the same case was charged with withholding evidence.
Three people were sentenced to death for murder. The sentences were passed in April, May and June.
Amnesty International called on the authorities to commute the death sentences and welcomed the steps taken towards the abolition of the death penalty.
