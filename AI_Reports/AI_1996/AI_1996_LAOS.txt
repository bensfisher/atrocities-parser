Three prisoners of conscience continued to be held throughout the year. Three political prisoners continued to serve sentences of life imprisonment imposed after unfair trials.
In March the National Assembly approved the first Cabinet reshuffle since major administrative changes in 1993. Censorship of the news media, restrictions on freedom of expression and lack of official information continued to make it difficult to obtain information about human rights abuses.
Three prisoners of conscience continued to be held in "Re-education" Camp 7 in the northern province of Houa Phanh. Thongsouk Saysangkhi, Latsami Kham-phoui and Feng Sakchittaphong had been sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in 1992 after a grossly unfair trial (see Amnesty International Report 1995). Conditions in Camp 7, which is situated in a remote area, were believed to be harsh and to lack medical facilities. All three men were believed to be suffering from ill-health requiring medical treatment.
Three political prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment after an unfair trial in 1992 continued to be held. Pangtong Chokbengboun, Bounlu Nammathao and Sing Chanthakoummane had previously been detained for 17 years without charge or trial (see Amnesty International Report 1995). They remained at Sop Pan camp in Houa Phanh province.
Amnesty International continued to appeal to the government of President Nouhak Phoumsavan for the immediate and unconditional release of prisoners of conscience, and the fair trial or release
from detention or restriction of other long-term political prisoners. By the end of the year no response had been received from the authorities.
