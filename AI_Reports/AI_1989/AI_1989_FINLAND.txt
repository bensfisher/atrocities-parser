At least nine objectors to military service served sentences as prisoners of conscience and several others received prison sentences they were expected to begin in 1989.
According to the revised law on unarmed and civilian service, which has been in force since 1987, conscripts who object to military service on ethical or religious grounds may undertake alternative civilian service for 16 months. However, this alternative is punitive, as it is twice as long as the period of military service. Several individuals given the option to perform alternative service in 1988 refused to perform it for this reason and were prosecuted. Markku Tattari, the head of a peace organization, was imprisoned in August when the Helsinki Court of Appeal confirmed a sentence imposed by Helsinki Municipal Court in 1987 because of his refusal to perform alternative service. One of Markku Tattari's reasons for refusing was his belief that the length of the alternative service was punitive.
At least eight other conscripts have refused to perform alternative service because of its length. Jarmo Kaarlela, Harri Makela, Raimo Rautiainen, Jukka Seppala, Jari Veijola and Pekka Ylonen began serving 11-month prison sentences in 1988. Jari Veijola was released from prison in December when he opted for civilian service; Ilkka Silo was released in October after serving nine months. Ahti Nio, who started a nine-month sentence in 1987 (see Amnesty International Report 1988), was released in September.

Amnesty International considered that because of its punitive length civilian service did not provide an acceptable alternative to military service and sought the release of conscientious objectors it considered prisoners of conscience.
