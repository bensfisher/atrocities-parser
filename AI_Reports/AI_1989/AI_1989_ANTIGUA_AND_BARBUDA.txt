ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA
The first execution for nine years was carried out by hanging on 5 May. The prisoner, Jimmy Williams, had been convicted of murder in July 1986.
Jimmy Williams' appeal to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal was withdrawn by his lawyer for reasons not known to Amnesty International. He had submitted a petition to the Mercy Committee (a government-appointed body which advises on clemency in death penalty cases] at the same time as two other men who had been sentenced to death for murder and whose appeals had been dismissed by the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal. Their sentences were commuted to prison terms but Jimmy Williams' petition was rejected.
Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister Vere C. Bird Sr expressing concern over the execution and at the fact that the death sentence imposed on Jimmy Williams had not been reviewed by a higher court, as required by the United Nations Economic and Social Council Resolution 1984/50, Safeguard 6.
