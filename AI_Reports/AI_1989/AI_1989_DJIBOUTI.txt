About 12 suspected supporters of an opposition group were reportedly detained without trial and tortured. Several hundred Somali asylum-seekers were held for some weeks and a number were ill-treated. Several Ethiopian refugees and asylum-seekers were also detained for short periods because of alleged pol-itlcal activities.
About 12 people believed to have been arrested for political reasons during 1988 were reportedly still detained at the end of
the year without having been tried. They were apparently suspected of links with an opposition group based in Ethiopia, Mouvement national djiboufien pour I'in-siauration de ia d√©mocratie, Djibouti National Movement for the Installation of Democracy. They were reportedly held initially by the security police at the Villa Christophe, a security detention centre in Djibouti town where they were allegedly tortured, and later transferred to Gabode Prison. Their legal status was not known.
In May and June several hundred Somali youths who had fled to Djibouti after fighting in northern Somalia between government forces and the opposition Somali National Movement (SNM) were arrested in Djibouti, reportedly for expressing support for the SNM. Several were reported to have been beaten in police custody. They were all released uncharged after some weeks.
Amnesty International investigated reports that a number of Ethiopian refugees and asylum-seekers had been detained for short periods without being charged, in some cases reportedly as punishment for opposing repatriation to Ethiopia, in other cases for alleged political activity. Over 20 people arrested in mid-December for alleged links with an Ethiopian opposition organization were released at the end of the month.
In December Amnesty International appealed to the Djibouti Government to ensure that no refugees in Djibouti would be forced to return to their country of origin or coerced, ill-treated or arrested if they opposed repatriation.
