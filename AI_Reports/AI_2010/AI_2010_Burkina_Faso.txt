Human rights defenders were harassed while promoting the fight against impunity. At least six people were sentenced to death. Despite continued efforts by the government, maternal mortality remained high.

Human rights defenders

In January, three members of the Collective against Impunity, including Chrysogone Zougmoré, President of the Burkinabè Movement for Human and Peoples' Rights (Mouvement burkinabè des droits de l'homme et des peuples), were summoned by the gendarmerie and questioned about the organization of a demonstration to mark the 10th anniversary of the killing of prominent investigative journalist, Norbert Zongo. No serious investigation was ever conducted into the killing.

Death penalty

At least six people were sentenced to death. Among them were two people convicted of murder during the November assize court session held in Dédougou in the west of the country. The last execution known to have been carried out was in 1988.

Right to health

Despite government efforts during the previous few years to improve access to maternal health services, including a reduction of fees, maternal mortality remained high. In October, the government passed two decrees to improve access to contraceptive services, but the use of contraception remained very low.

Amnesty International visits

Amnesty International delegates visited Burkina Faso in February, June and November.
