Two other prisoners of conscience, 19-year-old Aleksey Shidlovsky and 16-year-old Vadim Labkovich, both members of the bnf's Youth Front, stood trial in February on charges of "malicious hooliganism" under Article 201(2) of the Belarusian Criminal Code and "abuse of state symbols" under Article 186.

Human rights lawyers and advocates were persecuted by the authorities. Vera Stremkovskaya, a human rights lawyer, was called to meetings with officials at the Ministry of Justice, and at both the Be-larusian and the Minsk City Collegium of Advocates, in an attempt to put pressure on her and to initiate a process to disbar her. It appeared that the persecution and harassment of Vera Stremkovskaya were politically motivated.
The government officials also accused Vera Stremkovskaya of revealing case information about du-ee of her clients - Audrey Klimov, Vasiliy Starovoitov and Vladimir Kudzinnov - which they alleged constituted a violation of lawyers' ethics. The clients, all businessmen and former members of parliament of the 13 Supreme Soviet, dissolved by President Lukashenka, were imprisoned on charges of bribery. It was alleged that the real reason for their imprisonment was that they had publicly criticized the President's policies. They were prisoners of conscience. In September there were reports that Vladimir Kudzinnov had been ill-treated in Minsk colony UZH 15/1.
On 8 June lawyer Alyaksey Filip-chanka reportedly set himself on fire outside the Novopolotsk City Court building to protest against violations of human rights and the judicial process in Belarus. He died in August.

Many opposition supporters were beaten by police during arrest and in pretrial detention. Vyacheslav Sivchyk was reported to have been severely beaten by police on 2 April. He needed hospital treatment for concussion. Fourteen-year-old Anton Taras, arrested at the April rally commemorating the Chernobyl disaster, was allegedly forced by police to put on a gas mask he had worn symbolically during the rally. They then stopped the air supply until he began to suffocate, a torture method known as "elephant". No investigations were known to have been carried out into allegations of torture or ill-treatment.
The death penalty continued to be used extensively. However, information about the death penalty was hard to obtain as it is classed as a state secret. President Lukashenka reportedly stated in January that 30 people had been executed in 1997. At least 84 people were reportedly under sentence of death. The Deputy Procurator General of Belarus was reported to have said that 33 people were executed between January and August.
Prisoners facing imminent execution included five prisoners held in sizo No. 1 in Minsk; Ivan Fomin, Sergey Protiraev, Igor Sklyarenko, Mikhail Clushenok and Sergey Zababurin. Ivan Fomin and Mikhail Glushenok were reportedly tortured and forced to sign confessions. Four of them were thought to have received unfair trials. According to reports, prisoners under sentence of death in SizO No. 1 in Minsk were regularly ill-treated, including by being beaten with a wooden hammer. The death sentence on F. Verega was commuted to 15 years' imprisonment by the Supreme Court in January.
Amnesty International called for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience, including any demonstrators detained solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of assembly. It urged prompt and impartial investigations into allegations of ill-treatment and for anyone responsible to be brought to justice.
The organization called on the authorities to stop the apparent practice of censuring and silencing himian rights lawyers by

taking away their licences, including the attempts to disbar Vera Stremkovskaya. Amnesty Intemational called on the authorities to reinstate all human rights lawyers, including Nadezhda Dudareva and Gary Pogonyailo, who had previously been disbarred solely because of their human rights activities.
Amnesty International urged the government to abolish the death penalty and to declare a moratoriimi on executions. It called on the President to grant clemency to all those under sentence of death.
