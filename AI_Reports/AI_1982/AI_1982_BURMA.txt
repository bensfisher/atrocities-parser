Burma
Burma's isolation and the severe restrictions on access to the country maintained by the government made it very difficult to collect information on human rights violations. Amnesty International was unable to obtain detailed evidence of arrests, trials and political imprisonment Inside the country there appeared to be total censorship of news relating to human rights violations. Because of a wide-ranging amnesty in May 1980, under which more than 4,000 political prisoners were released, the number of political prisoners was believed to be relatively low.

As in earlier years Amnesty International received reports in 1981 of arrests and ill-treatment of people belonging to the country's many ethnic minorities. These reports in particular referred to the Karen and Shan minorities as well as Burma's Muslim community, the Arakanese or Rohingya. Individuals detained for alleged involvement in separatist movements, especially those held in Insein Jail in Rangoon, were reportedly tortured and ill-treated. Such reports proved difficult to substantiate.
Htun Myint Kyu, the former Secretary General of the Burma Muslim Organization, was released from prison at the end of the year (see Amnesty International Report 1981).
No death sentences were known to have been imposed in 1981. Although the death penalty is permitted under Burmese law it appeared that the authorities rarely resorted to its use.
