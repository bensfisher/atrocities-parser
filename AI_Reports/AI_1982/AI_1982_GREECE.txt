Greece
Jehovah's Witnesses continued to be sentenced to four to five years' imprisonment and loss of civil rights for at least five years for refusing on conscientious grounds to perform military service (see Amnesty International Report 1981). At the end of 1981 Amnesty International was working for the release of 51 imprisoned conscientious objectors but was informed that their total number was approximately 120.

On 24 November 1981 Amnesty International urged the newly elected Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to consider that "unarmed service within the military system is not a satisfactory alternative to military service". It stressed that although the only conscientious objectors in Greece known to Amnesty International were Jehovah's Witnesses, "we believe that all people liable to military service in Greece... should have the right to object to carrying out such service on conscientious grounds . . .".
On 15 April 1981 Amnesty International wrote to the Minister of Justice, George Stamatis, about alleged ill-treatment of prisoners in Korydallos Prison, but received no response (see Amnesty International Report 1981).
Greek law retains the death penalty, although no executions have taken place since 1972. On 1 October 1981 Amnesty International appealed to President Karamanlis to commute the death sentence passed in September 1981 on Hussein Ramadan, convicted of murder. It also called for the total abolition of the death penalty. In its letter of 24 November to Prime Minister Papandreou Amnesty International said that the abolition of the death penalty in Greece would be " of the greatest importance in the worldwide move towards abolition".
