Botswana
Amnesty International was concerned about the forcible repatriation of four refugees to South Africa in January 1981. This occurred after the government decided to move many South African refugees to Dukwe, northwest of Francistown, to a camp previously occupied by Zimbabwean refugees. There was some resistance by the refugees to the move. The authorities withdrew recognition from four refugees and summarily expelled them to South Africa. They were then detained without charge for a time by South African security police. All four were believed to have been released before 25 February 1981. Amnesty International informed the Botswana Government of its concern about the deportations and requested njore details of those involved. In response, the govenmient named them as Michael Lithoko, Wilson Fanyana Mashaba, Joseph Minare and Strike Mashilane.
In late March 1981 Daniel Kwelagobe, Minister of Public Service and Information, gave a public assurance that Botswana had not changed its policy of granting asylum to political refugees from South Africa. This appeared to be borne out by developments during the rest of the year. No further incidents involving the summary repatriation of refugees were known to have occurred in 1981.
