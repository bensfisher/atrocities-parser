Amnesty International was concerned about the detention without trial of Zair-ian refugees and the use of the death penalty.
In July 1981 seven Zairian refugees were arrested after demonstrating outside the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Bujumbura. They were released after two days, on 9 July, but were then rearrested on 11 July and detained in Mpimba Central Prison for more than two months. They were accused of "making threats and of bad behaviour", but were eventually released without being brought to trial.
In December 1981 two men were executed by hanging in Bujumbura, reportedly in public. One of them had been condemned to death in 1978 on a charge of cannibalism. His wife, convicted on the same charge, later had her death sentence commuted upon appeal to life imprisonment. The second man who was executed had been convicted of murdering three people; his death sentence had been upheld when he appealed against it in April 1981.
