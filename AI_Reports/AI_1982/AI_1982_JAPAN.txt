Amnesty International continued to appeal for the commutation of all death sentences and an end to executions, pending the abolition of the death penalty.
At least 40 prisoners were under sentence of death for murder. Eighteen of them had had their sentences confirmed by the Supreme Court, three during 1981. Amnesty International appealed for the commutation of the death sentences on Teruo Ono and Tatekawa Shujiro, confirmed by the Supreme Court on 16 and 26 June 1981. Three death sentences were imposed for murder by courts of first instance. Amnesty International learned of one execution in late 1981. The death penalty may be imposed for 17 criminal offences, 12 under the penal code and five under other laws.
