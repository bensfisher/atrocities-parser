Seychelles
A number of Seychellois nationals were arrested and believed to be detained under the Preservation of Public Security Regulations, which permit indefinite detention without charge or trial, following the unsuccessful attempt by foreign mercenaries to overthrow the government of President France-Albert Ren√© on 25 November 1981. Forty-five mercenaries escaped to South Africa, but six were captured in Seychelles. Together with an alleged accomplice (a South African citizen) arrested shortly afterwards, they were due to appear in court in 1982 to face charges which could include treason, the only offence in Seychelles carrying the death penalty. On 15 December 1981 the United Nations Security Council decided to send a commission of inquiry to Seychelles to investigate "the origin, background and financing" of the mercenary attack. At the end of the year Amnesty International was seeking information about the detention and treatment of at least 15 Seychellois nationals arrested in December. The government did not state the reasons for their detention and gave no indication whether they might face charges relating to the mercenaries' attack.
