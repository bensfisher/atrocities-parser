Little information on individual prisoners of conscience was available in 198L On 8 December 1981 Amnesty International wrote to the Government of the People's Republic ofKampuchea(PRK) to introduce its work and inquire about certain of its concerns. It asked about officials and soldiers of the former administration of Democratic Kampuchea who had been sent for "re-education" in accordance with Decision No. 2 of the Instructions of the People's Revolutionary Council Regarding Criminals, of 15 April 1979. According to these instructions former officials and soldiers had to appear before the new local authorities. Those who had "contracted a blood debt vis-Ã -vis the people", that is, had been responsible for murder, were to be tried Those against whom there was no such evidence were to be "re-educated" about the political policies and values of the new government. Most of these were believed to have been released.
Amnesty International urged the release of political prisoners who had not used or advocated violence, including those detained under the provisions of a memorandum from the Interior Ministry of 29 November 1979 on the arrest and "re-education" of "any person carrying out propaganda campaigns to sabotage internal unity and the Kampuchea-Laos-Viet Nam soHdarity".
