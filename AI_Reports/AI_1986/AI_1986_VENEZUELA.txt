Amnesty International remained concerned about the long-term detention of civilian political prisoners in military custody without the courts reaching a verdict. During 1985 Amnesty International was also investigating sporadic but serious allegations of ill-treatment of detainees by police. In January, 17 political prisoners were released by presidential order when Pope John Paul II visited Venezuela. TTiey were among a group of civilian prisoners held on the authority of military courts, pending trial proceedings which were often delayed for several years at a time. Other prisoners in this category remained in prison during the year. By the end of 1985 at least 15 were still in prison; they had been held for two to seven years on the authority of the military courts. To Amnesty International's knowledge, none had been convicted.
There were several reports of serious abuse of authority by police officers during 1985. In July three members of the Policía Técnica Judicial (PTJ), Judicial Technical Police, were discharged from the force and placed at the disposal of the criminal courts for the death under torture of Ernesto Jesús García, a criminal suspect. Among the cases of alleged ill-treatment that Amnesty Intemational was investigating was that of two members of a popular theatre group, Nelson Garcia and Mario Urdaneta Peche. They complained that they had been arrested on 4 October 1985 and tortured with electricity and by being beaten at the premises of the Dirección de los Servicios de Inteligencia y Prevención (DISIP), civilian political police. They were accused by their interrogators of being members of Bandera Roja, a guerrilla group, and were reportedly questioned about the activities of community groups. They were released after four days without charge.
