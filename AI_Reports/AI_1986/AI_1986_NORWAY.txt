Norway
On 12 November Amnesty Intemational wrote to the Minister of Justice urging the immediate release of Kjell Hàkon Paulsen, a 33-year-old student who was sentenced to 90 days' imprisonment for refusing military service on conscientious grounds. Between 1974 and 1980 Kjell Hàkon Paulsen had been granted a series of postponements of military service because of his university studies. On 2 January 1980 he applied to be recognized as a conscientious objector. He stated that he opposed Norway's military system and membership of NATO and would not serve in the army, but was prepared to carry out altemative civilian service. His application was rejected by the Ministry of Justice and he was tried by the County Court of Trondheim on 7 October 1983. The court's verdict was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court on 15 December 1983.
