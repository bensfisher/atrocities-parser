Dominican Republic
Amnesty International was concemed about a pattem of short-term detentions of Haitian pwUtical refugees and about the failure of the Dominican Republic authorities to investigate the cases of two people who had "disappeared" in previous years.
On 23 Apà Amnesty Intemational expressed concem to President Salvador Jorge Blanco about the arrests of two Haitian refugees, François Roger (known as Francisco Pérez) and Saintil Saintiles (or Saintil Joseph), on or around 17 April. According to reports they were involved in hteracy programs for the large community of Haitian workers that come each year to the Dominican Repubhc for the sugar cane harvest. There were frequent demonstrations against working conditions in the plantations, and short-term arrests of those believed to be responsible. Amnesty Intemational later leamed that François Roger and Saintil Saintiles were released without charge 48 hours after their arrest. Another Haitian refugee, Clarel Béhard, a member of Union des Forces Patriotiques Démocratiques Haïtiennes, Haitian Union of Patriotic Democratic Forces, was arrested, reportedly without warrant, on or around 8 June and taken to the police headquarters in Santo Domingo. His arrest was also believed to have been motivated by his activities to improve the working conditions of Haitian sugar cane workers. He was released on 13 June.
Over the years Amnesty Intemational has repeatedly pressed the Govemment of the Dominican Repubhc to investigate the whereabouts of Samuel Roche, a Haitian refugee who "disappeared" following his arrest on 4 June 1982, and Pablo Liberato Rodríguez, who "disappeared" after his arrest in 1974. However, Amnesty Intemational was not aware of any steps taken during 1985 to clarify the "disapi>earances" and to bring to justice those responsible.
