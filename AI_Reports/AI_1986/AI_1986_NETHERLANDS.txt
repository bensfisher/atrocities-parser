Netherlands
Amnesty Intemational wrote to the Prime Minister on 31 January to express its concern following an incident in which 45 Sri Lankan Tamils in transit from Sri Lanka to East Berlin were reported to have been apprehended at Schiphol airport and put on a flight retuming to Colombo. Amnesty Intemational opposed the involuntary return to Sri Lanka of members of the Tamil minority since it considered that they had re^nable grounds to fear they might be killed by the security services or arbitrarily detained and ill-treated if it was believed that they had any knowledge of the activities of Tamil extremist groups. In order to prevent further such occurrences the

Dutch Government was asked to review the procedures followed in this case, to strengthen existing safeguards against involuntary return and to develop further safeguards, as necessary. The government in its reply of 14 May stated that at no time did the 45 Sri Lankan Tamils request asylum or express fears of persecution and that, in the government's view, the existing procedures contained sufficient safeguards for people requesting asylum. Amnesty Intemational continued to seek information on the incident.
