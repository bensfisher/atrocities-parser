Brunei
Three long-term prisoners of conscience held under Emergency Orders without trial, two for more than 20 years, were released in November, but Amnesty International remained concemed about the continued detention of five others. All had been detained for their alleged involvement in an armed revolt in December 1962. On 5 September Amnesty Intemational appealed to the Sultan of Brunei to grant their unconditional release, as it believed that they continued to be detained not for their role in the rebellion but as a general deterrent to political activity. Several of the prisoners were thought to have reached advanced yeai^ and they were believed to be detained in virtual isolation. Press accounts of the release of the three men was the first news Amnesty Intemational had received of any of the prisoners since 1981.
During 1985, 11 political prisoners were released, while some 25 others were believed to remain in detention without trial, some having been held since the mid-1970s. The grounds for their detention were not made public.
In May Amnesty Intemational submitted information about its concems in Bmnei to the UN under its procedure for confidentially reviewing communications about human rights violations (the so-called "1503 procedure").
