The two prisoners of conscience who had been adopted by Amnesty Intemational were both released in January. They were Christopher Coker, a journalist, and L. Olu Mammah, an accountant. Both had reportedly been arrested in September 1984 on suspicion of possessing literature printed by an opposition political group.
On 13 and 14 March, special detachments of police and of the Special Security Division (SSD) reportedly detained some 600 suspected illegal immigrants at Koidu in the Kono district of eastem Sierra Leone. There were local protests and demonstrations against these arrests in which at least three people are reported to have died. Local members of the Sierra Leone Motor Drivers' Union called a strike to protest against the detention and ill-treatment of some of their members. This led on 18 March to at least 42 people being detained and charged either with offences against public order or with organizing a strike. Amnesty Intemational considered that some of those detained may have been prisoners of conscience. For example, Andrew Tamba Fasuluku Tache-Quee, a student, was among those detained on 18 March, when he was beaten unconscious by SSD officers. He was subsequently charged with organizing a lorry drivers' strike, although he was not known to have been a member of the union. He was acquitted by a court and released on 24 September.
