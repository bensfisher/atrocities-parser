Amnesty International received further information during 1985 on cases it had been investigating. Amnesty International had expressed concern to the government about the incommunicado detention and alleged ill-treatment of a number of people arrested in November 1983, following an alleged coup attempt. Five of the detainees were subsequently brought to trial in 1984 (see Amnesty International Report 1984 and 1985). According to the report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (lACHR) of the Organization of American States published in October, the detainees had been "effectively denied legal counsel until the day before their trials in July 1984, more than seven months after their arrest". The Commission also heard testimony that they were tortured "at the outset of their incarceration, in some cases lasting several months".
During 1985 Amnesty Intemational investigated allegations that two Surinamese soldiers had died in March under suspicious circumstances in their military barracks. According to initial reports, the government had announced that the deaths were "accidental" or "suicide" but relatives believed that they may have been summarily executed. Amnesty Intemational later leamed that two other soldiers had died during the same period, but was unable to clarify the circumstances of any of the deaths. The lACHR said in its report that it had raised the issue of the deaths with the Surinamese Govemment who informed it that an inquest had established that the men had died of natural causes. However, no inquest report was provided.
