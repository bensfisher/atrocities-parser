Papua New Guinea
Amnesty International appealed to the government in October and November to halt the forcible return of refugees to Indonesia. In June and October refugees from Irian Jaya, the easternmost province of Indonesia which borders Papua New Guinea, were forcibly repatriated and immediately imprisoned by Indonesian security forces. All were suspected of being sympathizers with the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM), the Free Papua Movement, which has been waging an armed struggle against Indonesia for the independence of Irian Jaya since the mid-1960s. Amnesty International believed that those returned might be tortured and ill-treated by the Indonesian authorities. It appealed to the government to seek formal assurances from the Indonesian Government that refugees already repatriated would not be ill-treated and to have its embassy staff in Jakarta follow up all reports of ill-treatment with the Indonesian authorities.
Amnesty International conveyed to the government its concerns about legislation introduced in Parliament in June which would, for crimes involving rape, reintroduce the death penalty (abolished in 1971), and impose mutilation and corporal punishment. No legislative action had been taken by the end of 1985.
