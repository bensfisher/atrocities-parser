In its report to the UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee, submitted in December 2001, Bahrain listed a number of measures it had taken. These included ratification of the Arab Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, many provisions of which were in violation of international human rights standards.
During the year more political associations and nongovernmental organizations were officially recognized. The General Committee of Bahrain Workers was officially registered as the General Union of Bahrain Workers in June and a law on trade unions was issued in September. In July the Bahrain Human Rights Centre was officially registered, the first such centre in the Gulf region. The Bahrain Women's Union, which works to defend and promote women's rights, was recognized in November.
Local elections took place in May and 320 candidates, including 31 women, contested 50 seats. The majority of seats were won by candidates linked to Sunni and Shi'a Muslim political associations. None of the women candidates won a seat.
For the first time since 1973 parliamentary elections were held in October and [90 candidates, including eight women, stood for election to the 40-member Council of Deputies. For many years, reinstatement of the parliament, which was dissolved in 1975, had been one of the opposition's main demands. However, the four leading political associations, including the main Shi'a Muslim opposition group, boycotted the elections to protest against constitutional amendments and the legislative powers granted to the Consultative Council. Sunni Muslim groups won the most seats. None of the women candidates was elected.
A new government was named in November with key ministerial posts unchanged. However, a former political opponent, Majid Muhsin al-'Alawi, was appointed Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.

There were reports of excessive use of force by security forces during widespread anti-USA and anti-Israel demonstrations in April in the capital, al-Manama.

In May the Qatar-based television channel al-Jazeera was banned from Bahrain for "deliberately seeking to harm Bahrain". The ban was said to have been connected with al-Jazeera's coverage of the anti-USA protests in Bahrain.
A new Press and Publications Law was issued by royal decree in October. Article 68 provides for up to five years' imprisonment for publishing articles that insult the state's religion, criticize the King or incite to overthrow or change the government. There were concerns that the law was restrictive and violated international standards on freedom of expression. At the end of the year the government reportedly withdrew the law to make amendments.
