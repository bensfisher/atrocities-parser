'Anti-terrorist' legislation
Opposition parties, civil society groups and AI expressed concern at provisions of the government's proposed "anti-terrorist" legislation which fail to meet international human rights standards. The legislation allows the police to detain "terrorism" suspects incommunicado for 36 hours and gives the government the right to extradite or deny them asylum and to return them to countries where they risk human rights abuses.
