In July, President Algirdas Brazauskas signed a decree effectively halting all executions pending discussion of a new criminal code by the Seimas (parliament). Nine prisoners were reported to be under sentence of death at the time the decree was announced.
Throughout the year Amnesty International appealed to the authorities for commutation of all pending death sentences.

The organization also urged the authorities to ratify Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which abolishes the death penalty in peacetime. In its letters to the authorities Amnesty International also expressed regret at the execution of Aleksandras Gudkovas, which it had learned about in December 1995, and asked for information regarding the exact date and place of execution, who was present and whether and how the execution was officially announced or reported. No response had been received by the end of the year.
