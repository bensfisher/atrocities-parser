In August, a new Constitution was adopted following a national referendum. V^ile claiming to reintroduce the rule of law under a civilian government, it granted members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (afprc) total immxmity from prosecution. The Constitution allowed for derogation of fundamental rights and freedoms during a state of public emergency, without specifying the criteria for such a derogation. The death penalty was retained.
Soon after the Constitution was adopted, the ban on political activities, in force since the July 1994 coup, was lifted. However, a decree was passed which disqualified former President, Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara, former Vice-President Sai-hou Sabally and all former ministers of the People's Progressive Party (ppp) from contesting any political office, Two pre-coup opposition parties were also banned from participating in both the parliamentary and the presidential elections. The penalty for contravening this decree was life imprisonment or a fine of one million dalasis (approximately us$100,000). A separate decree gave the Minister of the Interior and the security forces wide powers of arrest and detention, in some instances for 90 days, without any right of legal challenge by the detainee.
The presidential election in September, contested by four candidates, was won by Captain Yaha Jammeh, Chairman of the afprc. The promised transition to civilian rule was due to be completed by parliamentary elections scheduled for January 1997, after which the new Constitution adopted in August was due to come into force.
At least 28 people who appeared to be prisoners of conscience were held for most of the year.

Cham, also arrested in October 1995, wei;e released in September, after almost 12 months' detention without formal charges or trial.

At least three former members of the security forces, arrested in July 1994, and whose trial had been repeatedly adjourned, continued to be held (see Amnesty International Reports 1995 and 1996). They were possible prisoners of conscience. Pa Sallah Jagne, former Inspector General of Police, Ebrima Chongan, his deputy, and Kebba Dibba, Assistant Superintendent of Police, were tried in April and acquitted on various counts of stealing from the state while serving as government employees. Days later new criminal charges were brought against them. The magistrate who had acquitted them was dismissed. They remained in detention at the end of the year.
The whereabouts of two possible prisoners of conscience, believed to have been held incommucnicado at Jangjangbu-reh prison, were unknown. The authorities continued to deny that they had been arrested and detained.
