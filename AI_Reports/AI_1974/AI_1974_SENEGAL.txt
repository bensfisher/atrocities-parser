Senegal
In April 1974 the Senegalese government announced an amnesty for political prisoners. This resulted in the release of some individuals who had been held for more than 10 years and in the subsequent claim by the Senegalese authorities that no political prisoners were held in their country.
In late December 1974, however, a new wave of arrests began in academic and professional circles, and by early January a total of 19 persons were being held. Nine were later released on bail, but the remaining 10 were kept in custody and ultimately charged in April 1975 with the publicat'on of an illegal pamphlet Xare-Bi (The Struggle). The most prominent of those appearing in court was Landing Savan√©, a well-known Senegalese demographer of international standing,

who had been arrested on 18 March 1975 when he returned to Senegal. Prison terms of up to 2 years were passed on the accused.
At the time of writing (May 1975), Amnesty International was gathering data on these prisoners. AI was particularly disturbed by strong allegations that some of the prisoners arrested in December 1974 and January 1975 were subjected to torture during interrogation.
