Sudan
Following the mass arrests of September-December 1973, an amnesty in March 1974 freed most of the prisoners who had been taken up as investigation cases by Amnesty International groups. However, according to reports reaching the Research Department, more than 100 persons remained in intermittent detention under the provisions of the National Security Law promulgated in June 1973.
Since detentions under this law are nominally limited to a period of six months and ten days, it has proven difficult to obtain data on arrested persons in time for AI's traditional group adoption technique to become effective. In January and February 1975 new steps were taken by the Research Department to overcome this obstacle and to ensure that information about prisoners reaches the International Secretariat with as little delay as possible.
Detainees now held in Sudan include members or supporters of political parties covering a wide ideological spectrum, since the ruling Sudanese SociaUst Union is the only legally-recognized party in the country. The Sudanese Communist Party, the Umma Party, the Moslem Brothers (Islamic Charter Front) and the National Unionist Party have all suffered the arrest and detention of their leaders and alleged supporters.
The main prison used to house the detainees is Kober Prison in the northern part of the capital Khartoum, where conditions for political prisoners are reported to have deteriorated since the prison began to be used for detainees earlier this decade. No reading material apart from the Koran is allowed, and detainees are not permitted access to newspapers or radios. No visits to political detainees are permitted, and diet and bedding are inadequate. Prisons in Omdurman, Kassala, Port Sudan, El Obeid and E! Fasher have also been used to house political detainees. Prisoners transferred to El Obeid from Khartoum late in 1974 were reported to have been beaten and to have had their heads shaved.
