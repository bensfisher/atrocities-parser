Angola
Following the overthrow of the Caetano regime in Portugal in April 1974, the new Portuguese government began independence talks with the leaders of the three recognized liberation movements. These talks resulted in an agreement, signed in January 1975, establishing a provisional government to lead Angola to full independence on 11 November 1975.
Soon after the Portuguese coup d'Ã©tat, all Angolan political prisoners were released. Recognizing their needs, AI has provided financial assistance to a rehabilitation project.
Since it took power, divisions within the transitional government, which includes representatives from the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), have led to violent clashes between supporters of the three movements. Censorship of the press has been re-imposed and a number of individuals have been deported and imprisoned in Portugal.
