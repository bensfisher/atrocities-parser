Bahamas
In June 1974, Amnesty International Secretary General Martin Ennals sent a telegram to Prime Minister Lynden Pindling, appealing against reported moves to deport Haitian refugees and immigrants who have been working in the Bahamas for many years and who would run a high risk of arbitrary detention if returned to Haiti.
An appeal was also sent to the Prime Minister for commutation of two death sentences in August 1974, but both men were hanged in October 1974.
