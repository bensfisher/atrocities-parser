Swaziland
Amnesty International's activities in Swaziland have focused on the situation of refugees from South Africa. In mid-1974, AI learned of the arrest and detention of V.A. Shange, who had been associated with the opposition Ngwane National Liberatory Congress (NNLC) since his arrival in Swaziland some years before.
After representations had been made to the Swaziland government and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Mr Shange and two other detained refugees were released and allowed to take up offers of settlement in other countries. More recently, AI has taken up the cases of two more refugees from South Africa who are known to have been detained in Swaziland.
