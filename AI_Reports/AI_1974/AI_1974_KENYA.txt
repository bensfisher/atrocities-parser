Kenya
Amnesty International adoption groups continued throughout the year to work on the cases of two former members of the banned opposition party the Kenya People's Union (KPU), who had been detained without trial since 1969. These two prisoners are believed to be the only remaining KPU detainees, following the release in March 1974 of a third long-term detainee who had been the subject of an AI postcard campaign in February of that year. A third AI group continued to handle, as an investigation case, a prisoner who has been held without trial since June 1971, until news was received of his release in May 1975.
