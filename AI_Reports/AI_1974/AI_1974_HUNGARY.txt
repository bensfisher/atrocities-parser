Hungary
Amnesty International groups are at present working on five cases, of which two are re-adoptions: Dr Odon Lénárd and Dr Jozsef Szigeti. Both are Roman Catholic priests who had served long sentences for their perseverance in providing religious instruction to young people, and who were recently arrested again.
On 4 April 1975, an amnesty was proclaimed which also covers defectors in the West willing to return before the end of next year, but excludes political offenders.
Italy
Despite continuing difficulties in obtaining detailed information on political imprisonment in Italy, the number of adoptions increased to six during the year. All are conscientious objectors. Michele Camassa and Sergio Gulmini, both now adopted by Amnesty International, have each been sentenced to more than 3 and 2 years' imprisonment respectively after two successive trials. It is not uncommon for sentences passed by an Italian military court to be augmented in a second trial.
