Dominica ( West Indies)
In December 1974, Amnesty Intemational Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote to Prime Minister Patrick John of Dominica, appealing for the commutation of a death sentence which had been passed on Desmond Trotter, a member of the Movement for a New Dominica (MND), who was accused of shooting an American tourist. Although, as Mr Ennals pointed out in his letter, AI works for the abolition of capital punishment in all cases, he particularly urged that it should not be used in this instance because of doubts which existed regarding the guilt of the condemned man and the quality of the evidence against him.
Following information received in April 1975, the Secretary General wrote to the superintendent of the prison in which Desmond Trotter was held, asking to receive his assurance that the prisoner was not being subjected to ill-treatment.
AI has no adopted prisoners in Dominica.
