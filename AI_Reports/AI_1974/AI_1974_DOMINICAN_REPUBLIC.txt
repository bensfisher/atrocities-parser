Dominican Republic
In November 1974, Amnesty International Secretary General Martin Ennals addressed an appeal to President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic wliich, while congratulating him on the release of five adopted prisoners, also drew his attention to the deterioratii^ conditions in certain mral areas, especially in the vicinity of San Francisco de Macoris, the Dominican Republic's third largest city.
Major problems relating to violations of human rights at present exist inter alia in the functioning of the judicial system, the conditions within prisons and the treatment of arrested or suspected people, especially in rural areas. Research is now in progress to establish a legal framework in which to examine these violations.
President Balaguer's government, in power since 1966, was re-elected in May 1974, amid widespread allegations of irregularities in voting procedures. The opposition parties, as a consequence, refused to recognize the validity of this result. In the violent political climate which prevailed after the election hxmdreds of arrests were made. Some of those detained were only peripherally connected with political parties. These arrests appear to have been carried out in a brutal and illegal manner with the detainees frequently being denied the most elementary safeguards.
During the year Amnesty Intemational took up the cases of six people, a number which in no way reflects the tme extent of the problem in the Dominican Republic.
