On 5 December 1974, students from Rangoon University seized the coffin of former United Nations Secretary General U Thant from a funeral procession and put it in a makeshift mausoleum on the university campus. The action was generally interpreted as a symbolic protest against the government of President Ne Win, who took power in a military coup d'Ã©tat in 1962, since U Thant was identified with President Ne Win's long-standing political adversary, former President U Nu.
A week later widespread rioting and looting broke out. Martial law was declared following a night raid by troops and police on the university campus to recover U Thant's body. According to official statements, 2,887 students, Buddhist monks and women were arrested on the campus, while nine were killed and 70 wounded during the riots. (Unofficial estimates put the dead at between 50 and 70.)
By February 1975, more than 2,100 of those arrested had been released. A further 300 others were given prison sentences ranging from 3 to 12 years, after being tried by special courts in Rangoon. Another 52 were reportedly sentenced to between 3 and 10 years on 10 April 1975.
Early in 1975, the Minister of the Interior, U Ko Ko, told a meeting of the People's Assembly in Rangoon that "questioning of those detained during the riot was being sped up" and that "action would be taken only against the true
culprits". AI sent a letter to the Minister in May 1975 asking whether investigations had been completed and seeking information about any further prison sentences which may have been imposed by the special courts.
