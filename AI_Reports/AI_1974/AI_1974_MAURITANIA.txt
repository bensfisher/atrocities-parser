Mauritania
Although the 20 Mauritanian prisoners taken up as investigation cases by Amnesty International groups during 1973 were released on provisional liberty in March 1974, a new wave of arrests later took place in the country, apparently in response to the distribution of an anti-government leaflet. The detainees, who were reportedly being held at the Prison Civile de Beyla in the capital, Nouakchott, were mostly young people and students, and included some of the
1973	detainees.
By early 1975 none of the prisoners had been charged or brought to trial, and in consequence, between January and March 1975 AI adopted 30 of the detainees. In June AI learned of the release of these prisoners on "provisional liberty".
