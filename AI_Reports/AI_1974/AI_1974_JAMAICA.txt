Jamaica
In July 1974, Amnesty International Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote to Governor General Florizel Glasspole of Jamaica, appealing for commutation of the death sentence passed on Mario Hector who was convicted of murder on 25 February 1972. Mr Hector was, however, charged with the crime on 7 November 1970 when he was 17 years old and, under Jamaican law, not liable to capital punishment because of his youth. The Secretary General pointed out that this was in violation of article 11 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the last sentence of which states: "Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was apphcable at the time the penal offence was committed."
On 21 May 1975, following the decision by the judicial committee of the Privy Council in London that death sentences passed in 1971 on Eaton Baker and Paul Tyrell must stand, even though they were both under 18 years of age when they committed their offence, Mr Ennals cabled an appeal for their reprieve to the government of Jamaica. In a letter of 25 May, he cited article 6, paragraph 5 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: "Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below 18 years of age." On the same day, AI issued a news release about the case.
At the time of writing (June 1975) none of the men referred to above has been executed.
