Ivory Coast
Amnesty International groups continued throughout the year to work on the cases of prisoners arrested during October and November 1970 following an uprisii^ in the Gagnoa district in the southwestern region of the Ivory Coast. Following pressure from AI for a trial for these detainees (whose existence had been denied when AI first asked the government about them) they were eventually brought to court in Gagnoa during August 1974.
Tiie trial, which was open to the public, was attended by an AI observer, Marie-Claire Picard, a French lawyer. She reported that several defendants complained that they had been beaten or otherwise maltreated while in the custody of the police, and that the legislation under which they were tried was highly repressive in nature, having been promulgated in 1964 to punish an earlier plot to overthrow the government.
Although 55 persons were acquitted at the trial, severe prison terms ranging from 5 years to life were passed on 85 others. During March 1975 AI appealed to President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast calling on him to grant a general amnesty which would cover the prisoners sentenced at the Gagnoa trial.
