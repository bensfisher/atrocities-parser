Thailand
In December 1974, two months after the drawing up of a new constitution (an occasion traditionally marked by an amnesty), the interim National Assembly unanimously passed a bill designed to free more than 9,000 political prisoners. The prisoners, whose release under the terms of the amnesty bill took place in early 1975, had been jailed by decree under the old regime of Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn, which ended after student riots in October 1973.
According to the Ministry of the Interior in Bangkok, among those set free were 347 accused of involvement in communism, while others had been detained for a variety of reasons, including personal rivalry with, or in opposition to, the Thanom regime. Unofficial sources claimed that the great majority had been accused of communist activities. AI Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote to Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj of Thailand on 19 May 1975 seeking confirmation that the release of the 9,000 political prisoners has been completed, and requesting details of other categories of prisoners to whom the amnesty may not have applied.
Democratic Republic of Vietnam
Amnesty International groups continue to press inquiries about a small
104
number of adopted prisoners in North Vietnam, but with absolutely no response from the authorities in Hanoi. They include several members of a musical group of "pop" musicians imprisoned in 1971, and two members of the so-called Nhan Van group of writers and intellectuals (named after a newspaper of the same name) given 15-year sentences in 1960 on espionage charges. During the next few months, fresh attempts will be made to get details of the last two cases, first adopted by AI in October 1969, in view of the fact that they are now due for release.
