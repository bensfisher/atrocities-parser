Bhutan
On 1 June 1974, the day before the coronation of King Jigme Singye Wangchuk, the Bhutan government announced the discovery of a plot to assassinate the King. On 5 March 1974, 30 persons had been arrested, including the Bhutanese Deputy Home Minister, as well as 26 Tibetan residents in Bhutan. The arrests came at a time when the position of the some 3,500 Tibetan refugees in Bhutan had become increasingly precarious.
In a letter dated 18 November 1974, Amnesty International sought assurances from the King that the government would observe legal safeguards for those to be tried and that representations could be made in advance of those who might face the death penalty. AI representatives also discussed the trial and interrogation methods of these prisoners with the Bhutanese representative at the United Nations.
On 21 March 1975, Mumtaz Soysal, Turkish member of AI's International Executive Committee, presented a list of 23 prisoners to the Bhutanese representative in New Delhi. In their discussions, Mr Soysal learned that the trial of the prisoners had already finished and, in spite of assurances made on 29 July 1974 that the trial proceedings would be made public, transcripts were not available. According to the Bhutanese representative, five or six people were released, and, whereas some prisoners were sentenced to death, the King had commuted their sentences to life imprisonment. At present, AI is continuing its investigations into their trial and prison conditions.
