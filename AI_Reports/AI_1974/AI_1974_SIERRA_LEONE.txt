Sierra Leone
Following a bomb attack on the residence of Minister of Finance C.A. Kamara Taylor in the Sierra Leone capital Freetown on 30 July 1974, the government issued detention orders under the Public Emergency Regulations against some 35 people. A number of these were prominent political personalities who had been previously detained in 1970 when a new opposition party, the United Democratic Party (UDP), broke away from the ruling All People's Congress (APC). Several were former Amnesty International adoptees during their detentions from 1970 until 1973.
At the end of August 1974, 15 people appeared in court in Freetown charged with treason and plotting the unlawful overthrow of the government. In view of the grave nature of the charges and the possibility of the death sentence being imposed, Al Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote in early October to President Siaka Stevens appealing to him to ensure that the accused received a fair and public trial.
The trial did in fact take place in public and was amply reported in the local press. The accused also received the assistance of defence lawyers. In mid-November, however, all 15 were found guilty and sentenced to death. AI immediately appealed to President Stevens to commute the sentences. The 15 appealed to the Sierra Leone Court of Appeals, which rejected all but one of their appeals in May 1975. The 14 persons still under sentence of death are now appealing to the Sierra Leone Supreme Court.
In addition to the 15 persons brought before the courts, more than 80 individuals were detained under the Public Emergency Regulations in the wake of the bombing. Many have since been released, but the Research Department has taken up as investigation cases those few persons about whom sufficient data has been available.
