As in previous years, attempts were made to obtain a reprieve for Michael de Freitasâ€”also known as Michael X. When Mr de Freitas' final appeal against his death sentence was dismissed in May 1975, Secretary General Martin Ennals cabled the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in Jamaica to express Amnesty International's dissapointment at the decision, particularly because of the impUcations for others awaiting execution in the West Indies. He appealed to all the prime ministers to suport abolition of the death penalty throughout the Commonwealth.
