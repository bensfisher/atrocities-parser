Niger
In April 1974 the government of President Hamani Diori was overthrown by a military coup, just as Amnesty International was preparing to take up the cases of teachers, students and secondary school pupils who had been imprisoned for political offences in December 1973. Although the coup released political prisoners , President Diori and members and supporters oï \i\% Parti Progressiste Nigérien (PPN) were detained. In a letter to the new President of Niger, Colonel Seyni Kountché, in December 1974, AI Secretary General Martin Ennals expressed the organization's concern at the continuing restriction of ex-President Hamani Diori and others.
