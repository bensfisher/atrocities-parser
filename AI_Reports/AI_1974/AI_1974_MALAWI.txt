Malawi
An Amnesty International appeal for a general amnesty on 14 May 1974 (Kamuzu Day—a national holiday) was specifically rejected by President Hastings Banda of Malawi. Nonetheless, about 40 political detainees were released on that date. Further AI initiatives were taken to encourage a general amnesty on 6 July 1974—the 10th anniversary of Malawi's independence-but no such act of clemency was granted.
During the remaining months of 1974 AI heard of the release of a number of prisoners, but the general human rights situation in Malawi continued to deteriorate. In a speech made during September 1974, Dr Banda confirmed that a number of individuals had been executed for political crimes of violence. More people were detained, adding to the more than one thousand persons who are now held without trial at various prisons and detention centers in Malawi: specifically Mikuyu Detention Center near Zomba, Zomba and Lilongwe Prisons, and Chichiri Remand Prison, Blantyre.
Prison conditions in the main detention center at Mikuyu are reportedly very bad, with inadequate diet, medical attention and facilities for exercise. During the year AI received unconfirmed reports of the deaths in detention of 10 prisoners. It also received eye-witness accounts of the poor prison conditions from released European detainees who have reached Europe.
