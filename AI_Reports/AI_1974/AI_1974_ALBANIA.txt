Albania
During 1974-75 Amnesty International tried to obtain more information about political imprisonment in Albania but it proved extremely difficult due to the country's continuing isolation from the outside world. An approach by AI to the Albanian legation in East Berlin proved fruitless.
A Greek ex-prisoner, however, supplied more details about the camp of Ballsh, where 1,000 prisoners are held. He had spent more than a year in the camp after escaping from a Greek prison in the island of Corfu in 1972.
It is impossible to estimate the total number of political prisoners in Albania, but figures like 300,000, frequently mentioned by Albanian refugees, seem to be grossly exaggerated. The number of religious prisoners is believed to be particularly high in Albania where the performance of religious rites is illegal and severely penalized. Banishment to labour camps is common practice and is invariably applied to those who step out of the Communist Party line. In 1975 the names of six prominent Albanian writers and artists, still imprisoned or in corrective labour camps, reached AI. Albania, however, remains an almost closed society about which little is known in human rights terms.
