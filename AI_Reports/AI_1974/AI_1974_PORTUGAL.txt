Portugal
After the April 1974 coup that overthrew the government of Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano, the new Portugese Armed Forces Movement (MFA) government released all the prisoners of the former regime and initially restored freedom of expression. Amnesty Intemational continued to collect information on released prisoners in order to allocate relief funds for those in need of after-care.
After the two abortive coups of September 1974 and March 1975, which resulted in President Antonio de Spinola's exile and the radicalization of the MFA, a new category of people was arrested. It comprised bankers and businessmen, former members of the ousted government members of wealthy families, several hundred soldiers and officers of the armed forces who opposed the policies of the new government, and, more recently, approximately 200 members of the now-banned Maoist Party, the MRPP {Movimento de reorganizagao do Partido do Proletariado). It appears that habeas corpus has been suspended for those under military jurisdiction, that none have been charged, that many of them have been discouraged or prevented from seeing a lawyer, and that a "revolutionary tribunal" will be organized to judge those allegedly responsible for the 11 March coup attempt.
Press reports estimate that more than 500 prisoners are still held for political Feasons-a figure that takes no account of the 1,000 members of the former political police (PIDE) detained on criminal charges. In June 1975, an AI mission consisting of Secretary General Martin Ennals, French lawyer Christian Bourguet and Josette Bos of the Research Department, visited Lisbon and discussed this situation with President Costa Gomes and other government officials.
