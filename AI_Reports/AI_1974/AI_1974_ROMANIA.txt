Romania
Amnesty Intemational is currently working on nine cases which roughly divide into two main categories: persons imprisoned for religious beliefs and members of ethnic minorities. The best known are Vasile Rascol, a Pentecostal

minister, sentenced in July 1974 to 2 years' imprisonment for having received and distributed bibles and religious literature from abroad outside official channels, and Zoltan Kallos^ an outstanding folklorist and musicologist of Hungarian extraction, who was sentenced in December 1974 to years imprisonment for alleged homosexual connections. It seems probable that an important factor in the decision to prosecute Kallos was his untiring work collecting Hungarian folk ballads on the territory of Romania.
Most of AI's cases are members of the German minority sentenced for trying to leave the country illegally after being refused emigration passports by the authorities. Unconfirmed information also reached AI about excessively harsh prison conditions under which at least 13 members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church are suffering. The same source reports that a court in the northern Romanian town of Viseul sentenced seven couples to 3 years' imprisonment and deprived them of custody of their children because the parents had insisted that the children should be given religious education.
On 28 October 1974 the Socialist Republic of Romania ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Following an AI appeal to President Nicolae Ceausescu to commute the death sentence on Richard Szattinger, a Romanian citizen, the Romanian ambassador in London was instruc-

ted to receive AI Secretary General Martin Ennals on 17 April 1975 to assure him that the death sentence had not been confirmed yet. After discussing the plight of prisonere in Romania adopted by AI, the ambassador promised to pass on the information to the authorities in Bucharest and seek their comments.
