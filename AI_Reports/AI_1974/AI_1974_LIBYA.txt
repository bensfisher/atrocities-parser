Libya
Amnesty International has learned that, of the 300-400 Libyan's arrested following the popular revolution in April 1973 for their alleged opposition to the government, 130 still detained were tried in the summer of 1974. The court ordered their release, but the government authorities countermanded the order and they were re-arrested the same day.
Since then many more have been released and about 40 remain in detention: two alleged Trotskyists, 12-15 members of the Moslem Liberation Movement and 22 alleged Marxists. None have been sentenced and none now have access to their lawyers. Almost all are in Tripoli Central prison where treatment and conditions are said to be satisfactory. Efforts are being made to establish whether the four Libyans adopted by AI are among those still in detention.
