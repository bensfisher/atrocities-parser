Somalia
In October 1974 Amnesty International adopted 13 teachers who were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 7 to 10 years in April 1974 for organizing and taking part in an illegal strike. Under the National Security Law of 10 September 1970, all strikes are banned.
A further trial took place in Somalia in October 1974, when former Prime Minister Mohammed Ibrahim Egal was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment and a heavy fine on charges of corruption. Mr Egal had been an AI investigation case during his imprisonment without trial from October 1969 (when his government was overthrown by a military coup) until April 1973. In November 1974, Al Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote to President Muhammad Siad Barre, head of Somalia's Supreme Revolutionary Council for clarification of the exact charges

which had been brought against Mr Egal and the nature of the court before which he was tried.
In January 1975 10 men were executed by firing squad in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, after having been found guilty in the National Security Court of "exploiting religion to create national disunity and subverting state authority". They were aUeged to have mounted a campaign of "false propaganda" against a decision earlier in the month by the Supreme Revolutionary Council to grant equal rights to women in Somalia, which is a predominantly Islamic country. AI immediately cabled its protest at these shbo tings to President Siad Bar re, denouncing the executions as a fl^rant violation of the right to life clause of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
