On 18 July 1974 a wide-ranging amnesty was proclaimed which covered all sentences up to 2 years, but which affected political prisoners only marginally. Although Professor Jerzy Bafia, First Chairman of the Supreme Court, denied the existence of political "delinquency" in Poland, he nevertheless admitted that "there are a few persons in the penal establishments who might be said to have committed offences of a political character and to whom the amnesty may apply". Shortly afterwards it was officially admitted that seven persons had been imprisoned for political offences.
Meanwhile, several political prisoners were released in November 1974, among them three leaders of the	groupâ€”persons who were sentenced in 1971 to
prison terms ranging from 4 to 7 years for alleged anti-state activities. Unconfirmed reports from Poland nevertheless allege that more than 80 militants of the illegal pro-Albanian "Communist Party of Poland", led by Kazimierz Mijal, were arrested during the last year and sentenced to long prison terms. (The official ruling party is called the Polish United Workers' Party: officially there is no Communist Party in Poland.)
