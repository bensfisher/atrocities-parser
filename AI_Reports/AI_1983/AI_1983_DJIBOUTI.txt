Djibouti
On 3 January the government released former Prime Minister Ahmed Dini and six other leaders of the Parti populaire 4jiboutien (PPD), Djibouti People's Party. They had been detained without defined legal status since September 1981 when all 13 leaders of the newly formed PPD were arrested. President Hassan Gouled publicly accused them of subversion and anti-state activities but none was charged with any offence or brought to court. Six were released in October 1981 after the constitution had been amended to make Djibouti a one-party state with the ruling Rassemblement populaire pour le progr√®s (RPP), People's Progress Party, as the only legal political party. Amnesty International had appealed to the government for their unconditional release as prisoners of conscience.
In February 1982 Amnesty International received reports that 88 Ethiopian refugees, mainly students, had been arrested in the capital, Djibouti-ville, put on a train to the Ethiopian border under guard, and handed over to the Ethiopian authorities on 16 February. Some were said to be recognized refugees, while others had applied for asylum. Amnesty International expressed concern to the Djibouti Government at the danger caused by these expulsions to the lives and liberty of the refugees. The government claimed in its reply that the 88 foreigners expelled to Ethiopia and a further 100 expelled to Somalia were illegal entrants involved in robbery and armed attacks. Amnesty International's further interventions, referring to the names of recognized refugees among those expelled, who had reportedly been subsequently imprisoned in Ethiopia, received no response. Amnesty International was investigating reports in December 1982 of further arrests and expulsions of Ethiopian asylum-seekers.
