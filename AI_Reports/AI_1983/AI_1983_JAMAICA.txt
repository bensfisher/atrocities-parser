Amnesty International's major concern was an increase in executions. Ten people were hanged during the year, bringing to 14 the number of people executed since 1980.
Amnesty International issued urgent appeals for clemency for seven people who were hanged in September, all of whom had been under sentence of death for some six years. They had been convicted of murder between March 1975 and November 1976, but all executions were suspended from A pril 1976 until 1979, while parliament considered the abolition of the death penalty. On 30 January 1979 theHouse ofRepresentatives voted 23 to 20 for retention, with a recommendation that all existing death sentences be reviewed. No reprieves were granted in the above cases, however, and dates for execution were set for May and June 1979.
Five of the condemned men sought a ruling from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (which serves as the final appeal court for Jamaica) that executions after such a long delay would be "inhuman and degrading punishment" in violation of the Jamaica Constitution. The appeal was dismissed in a judgment given

on 28 June 1982 by a majority of three to two. The majority opinion, although rejecting the appeals on technical grounds, stated that "long delay in the execution of a death sentence, especially delay for which the condemned man is himself in no way responsible, must be an important factor to be taken into account in deciding whether to exercise the prerogative of mercy."
Jamaican law provides a mandatory death sentence for murder. However, the Governor-General, in consultation with the Jamaica Privy Council, has the power to exercise clemency.
In addition to those executed in September, two prisoners were hanged inMarch 1982 and one in June 1982. Amnesty International had appealed for clemency in all these cases.
A committee on Capital Punishment and Penal Reform, set up in 1979, submitted its report to the government in December 1981 but its findings had not been made public by the end of 1982. It is, however, known to have recommended that all death sentences imposed before 31 March 1981 be commuted. At the end of 1982, 103 prisoners were under sentence of death. Most were sentenced before March 1981, many of them during the period in which executions were suspended.
On 16 November Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister Edward Seaga requesting a meeting. The government had not replied by the end of 1982.
