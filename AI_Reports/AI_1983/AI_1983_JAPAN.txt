Amnesty International continued to appeal for the commutation of all death sentences and the abolition of the death penalty.
On 12 March 1982 Amnesty International wrote to the Minister of Justice Michita Sakata about the draft revision of the penal code being prepared by the government for submission to the Diet (parliament). Under this draft the number of offences punishable by death would be reduced. In the letter Amnesty International noted that no death sentences had been imposed in recent years for the offences for which the death penalty

would be abolished under the draft; it urged the total abolition of the death penalty and the cessation of executions.
At least 50 prisoners were believed to be under sentence of death for murder; nine had been sentenced by a court of first instance in 1982. The retrials of Sakae Menda. sentenced to death in 1950, and Shigeyoshi Taniguchi, sentenced to death in 1952, continued. It was not known whether any prisoners were executed during the year.
