Tanzania
Amnesty International was concerned about the retention of laws allowing the indefinite detention without charge or trial of prisoners of conscience, and the death penalty.
Tanzania signed the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on 31 May 1982.
Little information was available on the number or names of people detained without trial on mainland Tanzania under the Preventive Detention Act. A number of detainees were believed to have been released in 1982. Although the act had in previous years been used against political opponents, detainees in 1982 appeared to be mainly alleged "economic saboteurs".
Amnesty International learned of the arrest in Zanzibar during November of Ali Sultan Issa, a former Minister of Education, who was imprisoned from 1973 to 1978 and was then adopted as a prisoner of conscience. He was reportedly arrested in 1982 in connection with the circulation of leaflets criticizing the Zanzibar Government and calling for its resignation. Amnesty International requested details from the Zanzibar authorities on the grounds for his arrest and on his legal status, but received no reply by the end of 1982. He was presumed to be detained without charge or trial under Zanzibar's separate Preventive Detention Act. Amnesty International believed that he was a prisoner of conscience.

Amnesty International was concerned about the use of the death penalty, although the number of those sentenced to death or executed in 19 82 was not known. In July the Minister of Justice stated that 444 death sentences had been commuted since independence in 1964, but that commutation was not extended to those convicted of murder in connection with robbery. The number of people executed since 1964 was not stated.
