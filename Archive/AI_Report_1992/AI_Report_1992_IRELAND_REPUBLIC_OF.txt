New evidence emerged in support of a former prisoner's allegations of ill-treatment in police custody.
Osgur Breatnach, Nicky Kelly and Brian McNally were convicted in 1978 of involvement in the 1976 Sallins mail train robbery, solely on the basis of confessions allegedly obtained by ill-treatment during incommunicado detention. Another man allegedly ill-treated, John Fitzpatrick, had initially been charged with involvement in the robbery but the charges against him had been dismissed. The Court of Criminal Appeal ruled in 1980 that the confessions of Osgur Breatnach and Brian McNally had been involuntary and quashed their sentences. Nicky Kelly was released on "humanitarian grounds" in 1984. All three attempted to bring civil actions for damages against the state (see Amnesty International Reports 1990 and 1991).
In October 1991 an Irish television documentary reported that linguistic analysis of Nicky Kelly's alleged confession cast further doubt on its authenticity. The speech pattern expert who carried out the analysis said that he was "perfectly confident" that the words allegedly spoken could not have come from Nicky Kelly. He declared that the alleged confession could not have been the work of one person, and that at least two people had been involved in its production.
In the light of the new linguistic analysis evidence in Nicky Kelly's case, in October Amnesty International renewed its call for an independent inquiry into all the allegations of ill-treatment in custody made in connection with the Sallins robbery case.
