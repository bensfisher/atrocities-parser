ST VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
One prisoner was executed and one death sentence was commuted. At the end of the year there were three people - a woman and two men - under sentence of death.
Phillip Saunders was hanged on 16 August. He had been sentenced to death for murder in 1986 and the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal in 1988. The last execution had taken place in 1988.
In August the Governor General commuted the death sentence of Cleus Home on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy: he had been sentenced to death for murder in 1987 and his appeal was dismissed in 1988.
Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister James Mitchell in October to register its deep concern at the execution of Phillip Saunders. He had not appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (jcpc) in London, which acts as the final court of appeal for St Vincent and the Grenadines. The organization was concerned that he may not have been aware of the possibility of appealing to the icpc or of requesting financial assistance for doing so. Amnesty International said that any prisoner sentenced to death should be provided with all possible safeguards, including appeals to the jcpc. Amnesty International reiterated its concern that the country's laws allow people aged under 18 to be sentenced to death, in clear contravention of

international standards. The organization welcomed the commutation of Cleus Home's death sentence and urged the Prime Minister to commute pending death sentences and to initiate procediures for the total abolition of the death penalty. Amnesty International had not received a reply by the end of the year.
