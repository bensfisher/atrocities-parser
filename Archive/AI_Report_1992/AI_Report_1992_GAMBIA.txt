A possible prisoner of conscience was imprisoned briefly and a criminal suspect died in custody, apparently as a result of torture.
In February the remaining 35 prisoners convicted in connection with a coup attempt in 1981 were released in an amnesty granted by President Dawda Jawara. Nine had been serving sentences of life imprisonment.
Hassan Sanyang was arrested in October, apparently because he is the brother of Kukoi Samba Sanyang, the exiled leader of the 1981 coup attempt who was suspected of plotting against the government again. Hassan Sanyang was held for four days,

released on police bail and then rearrested and held for a further eight days before being released uncharged. He appeared to be a prisoner of conscience. Several foreign nationals resident in the Gambia were also detained briefly in October for questioning about possible links with Kukoi Samba Sanyang but then released uncharged and expelled.
In August a suspected criminal, Mamudu Jarju, died in custody in Brikama, reportedly as a result of torture. He was arrested on 2 August with three others, all apparently suspected of involvement in a burglary at his workplace. He died at Brikama police station within one day of his arrest. A month later three police officers were charged with murder and assault. They went on trial before the Supreme Court in October and the case received considerable publicity throughout the coimtry. A forensic report presented as evidence stated that Mamudu Jarju had suffered a dislocation of the spine which could only have been caused by excessive force being applied to the head and neck in a way which could not be self-inflicted.
Amnesty International continued to monitor the trial of the three officers charged with the murder and assault of Mamudu Jarju.
