SEYCHELLES
Two advocates of multi-party democracy who were briefly detained were prisoners of conscience. Criminal prisoners were allegedly ill-treated in a prison for civilians run by the army.
In December the Constitution was amended to allow the formation of political parties other than the ruling Seychelles People's Progressive Front (sppf). The sppf, led by President France-Albert René, had been the sole legal political party since 1979.
Jean François Ferrari, an advocate of multi-party democracy, was arrested and held overnight in April for distributing anti-govemment leaflets. Another opposition activist, Frank Kilindo, was detained in May under the Public Security (Detention) Regulations 1981, which permit indefinite administrative detention. He was detained for possessing leaflets urging support for the Parti Seselwa, Seychellois Party, an illegal opposition party. He was released uncharged in mid-June.
Convicted criminal prisoners held at Grand Police camp, a high security prison run by the army on the island of Mahé, were alleged to have been ill-treated. It was said that inmates were made to imdertake excessively strenuous labour and some were reportedly beaten. However, reports that one prisoner had required hospital treatment as a result of a beating by prison guards were strongly denied by the govemment and appeared not to be well-founded.
Amnesty Intemational appealed for the release of Frank Kilindo, and in November wrote to the govemment after receiving
reports that a criminal prisoner had been beaten and ill-treated. The authorities responded by firmly denying this and providing details of his health and medical treatment. In December the Minister of Planning and Extemal Affairs discussed human rights concems dining a visit to Amnesty International's Intemational Secretariat.
