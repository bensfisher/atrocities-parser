BARBADOS
One woman and three men were sentenced to death and 13 prisoners remained under sentence of death. There were no executions; the last hanging took place in 1984. Sentences of corporal punishment continued to be imposed and at least two were carried out.
There was concern in March that executions were to be resumed but none was carried out.

Sentences of flogging continued to be imposed. Four men were sentenced to be whipped with the tamarind rod, and to serve prison terms, on conviction of aggravated robbery; two of these sentences were carried out in February. The sentence of
flogging with a cat-o-nine-tails (a device consisting of nine knotted cords or thongs of raw hide attached to a handle) was reintroduced in February. Five men, separately convicted of aggravated robbery or rape, were sentenced to prison terms and to between nine and 12 strokes with the "cat". Reportedly, none of these flogging sentences was carried out. Sentences specifying the use of the "cat" had not been passed since the early 1950s and were believed to have been last carried out in 1938.
Amnesty International wrote to the Governor General, Dame Nita Barrow, in March to express concern about reports that executions were to be resumed. The organization urged her to exercise her prerogative of mercy and stay any proceedings to execute prisoners which might have been in progress. It also urged her to commute all death sentences.
In December Amnesty International wrote to the government noting that flogging and other forms of corporal punishment constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and as such contravene Barbados' Constitution and international conventions ratified by Barbados. It urged the government to abolish flogging as well as the death penalty.
