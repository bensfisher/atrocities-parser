FINLAND
Three conscientious objectors to military service began serving prison sentences; one of them completed his sentence and was released. One conscientious objector imprisoned in 1990 was also released on completion of his sentence. All four were considered prisoners of conscience.
Draft legislation before the Finnish parliament proposed that alternative service for conscientious objectors be reduced from 16 months to approximately 13 months.
In December 1990 Finland had ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhiunan or Degrading Treatment or Pimishment. In April Finland

ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty.
Three conscientious objectors began serving their sentences. Janne Mäkinen, gm editor, began serving a seven-and-a-half-month sentence in February. Kari Hämäläi-nen, a student, began serving a six-month sentence in September. Timo Tapani Kar-jalainen, a metal worker, began serving an 11-month sentence in October.
Two conscientious objectors were released after serving their sentences: Hannu Puttonen (see Amnesty International Report 1991] was released in June and Janne Mäkinen was released in October.
Amnesty International considered that the 16-month length of alternative service for conscientious objectors (twice the length of ordinary military service) could be deemed a punishment for the nonviolent expression of conscientious beliefs. The organization therefore considered conscientious objectors who refused to perform alternative service to be prisoners of conscience.
