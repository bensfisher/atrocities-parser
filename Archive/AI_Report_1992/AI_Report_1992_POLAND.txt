Poland became a member of the Council of Europe in November. In the same month Poland signed the European Convention on Human Rights; it had not yet ratified this instrument by the end of the year. Also in November Poland acceded to the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
In March the Ministry of Justice ordered the Regional Procurators to investigate all allegations of ill-treatment in detention between January 1990 and February 1991. Official sources reported 756 such complaints in this period. They said that in most cases no action was taken owing to lack of evidence. However, in 33 cases 52 police officers were prosecuted, including six officers from Slupsk Region sentenced to six to eight years' imprisonment for the 1990 beating of Henryk Twardowski, who had died as a result (see Amnesty International Report 1991).
In October Amnesty International requested information on the outcome of the investigations into allegations of ill-treatment in custody, No reply had been received by the end of the year. It also called for the abolition of the death penalty.
