MONGOLIA
Prisoners in corrective labour institiitions died of starvation. At least 26 people were sentenced to death.
Two weeks of anti-government protests in April in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, ended when parliament agreed to debate anti-corruption legislation and President Puntsalmaagiyn Ochirbat announced the preparation of a draft law to free the mass media from government control. In July the government banned demonstrations in Ulaanbaatar's central square.
Reports were received that inmates in corrective labour institutions had died from starvation because the administration did not have the money to provide sufficient rations. Out of an official figure of 90 deaths of prisoners in such institutions between late 1993 and late 1994, around 30 were directly attributed to starvation and an unknown number of the remainder to illnesses which may have been caused or exacerbated by starvation.
The death penalty remained in force for five offences (see Amnesty International Report 1994). At least 26 death sentences were passed. It was not known whether any executions took place.
At talks with officials in December, an Amnesty International delegation to Mongolia raised the issue of the gross neglect of prisoners' welfare which had resulted in deaths by starvation and called on the authorities to take immediate steps to alleviate this situation. Amnesty International continued to call for the abolition of the death penalty.
