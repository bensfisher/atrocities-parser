BHUTAN
A government critic was imprisoned as a prisoner of conscience.
In May the government of King Druk Gyalpo Jigme Singye Wangchuck reportedly decreed that Bhutanese who did not wear national dress in public could be imprisoned for one week or fined,
Ratan Gazmere, a teacher, author of pamphlets and campaigner on behalf of minority rights, was arrested in October for "anti-national activities", an offence punishable with death. He was still held without trial at the end of the year.
Amnesty International expressed its concern to the Bhutanese Government that Ratan Gazmere had been arrested simply because he had written and distributed literature on minority rights. In response, the government stated that Ratan Gazmere had been arrested not solely for his writings, but also for "anti-national activities". The government said Ratan Gazmere would receive a fair trial.
