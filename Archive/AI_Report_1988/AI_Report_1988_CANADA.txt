CANADA
In June the Canadian Parliament voted 148 to 127 against a motion to reinstate the death penalty, which had been abolished for ordinary crimes in 1976.
Following the election of the Progressive Conservative Party to power in 1984, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had promised to allow a free vote on the subject.
During the parliamentary debate he argued that the death penalty did not deter crime and said that Canada's homicide rate had reached a 15-year low since the death penalty was abolished in 1976, with the murder rate in 1986 declining by 20 per cent in one year.
Amnesty International wrote to Canadian members of Parliament before the vote, urging them not to support the re-introduction of the death penalty.
In November Amnesty International learned that two prisoners were awaiting extradition to face charges of murder in Florida and Nevada, USA, whose laws provide for the death penalty. Amnesty International urged the Minister of Justice to obtain assurances from the Florida and Nevada authorities that the two men would not be sentenced to death if convicted of murder. It asked the Minister to make such assurances a prerequisite for their extradition.
In June Canada ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture.
