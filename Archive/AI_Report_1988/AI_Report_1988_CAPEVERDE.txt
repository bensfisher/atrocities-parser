CAPEVERDE
Three people were convicted after political slogans were painted on walls in Min-dele in November. On the island of Brava one prisoner died after he and two others were reportedly tortured.
In November loao Alfredo Fortes Dias was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and a fine for painting political slogans on walls in Mindelo. The slogans were judged to have libelled a politician and to have defamed the ruling Partido A/rícano da índependéncia de Cabo Verde (PAICV), African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde, and the People's
National Assembly. Two other people were given suspended sentences and fined for the same offence. Having lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court, Joao Alfredo Fortes Dias was provisionally released.
Arlindo Gongalves, a 19-year-old suspected of arson, died in police custody on the island of Brava in early November, apparently as a result of torture. Two others arrested with Arlindo Gongalves were also reported to have been severely beaten. Three police officers responsible for the custody of the three men were arrested.
In luly Cape Verde acceded to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights.
Amnesty International asked the government about the precise nature of the charges against the three people convicted in November in Mindelo to determine whether they had been convicted of a recognizable criminal offence or for expression of their non-violent opinions. The organization also expressed concern about the allegations of torture and ill-treatment of the three prisoners in Brava.
