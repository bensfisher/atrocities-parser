ST VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

Two prisoners were hanged on 6 March 1987 - the first executions to be carried out for nine years. The two men, Seymour Castello and Wendell Williams, had been convicted of murder. An appeal by a local human rights group to Prime Minister James Mitchell, who chairs the Mercy Committee, failed to persuade the authorities to stay the executions or commute the death sentences. The death penalty is mandatory on conviction of murder. At least two other prisoners were believed to be under sentence of death at the end of the year.
Amnesty International expressed regret to the government about the executions

and called for a parliamentary discussion as a first step towards the abolition of the death penalty.
