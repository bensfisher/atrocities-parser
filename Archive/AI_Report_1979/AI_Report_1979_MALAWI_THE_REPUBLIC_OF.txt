Malawi (the Republic of)
Malawi's first general election since independence in 1964 was held on 29 June 1978 in what was widely interpreted as an attempt by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda to improve his government's authoritarian and repressive image. Only members of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) - the only legal poUtical party since 1966 - were entitled to contest the election; but voting was heavy and 31 out of a total of 87 sitting members of parUament were defeated. Few changes appear likely and power remains firmly in the hands of President Banda.
On the day foUowing the election, President Banda held an international press conference in which he criticized Amnesty International and discussed his government's record on human rights. He claimed that all political detainees had been released bv 4 July 1977, but refused to permit foreign journalists to visit prisons. He defended the banning and persecution of the Jehovah's Witnesses religious sect on the grounds that its members refused to pay taxes, recognize his government's authority or salute the flag.
Despite President Banda's assertion. Amnesty International believes that there remain a number of political detainees, including some held since 1970. Two chiefs arrested in 1973 are thought to be still detained, as are several former associates of Cabinet Minister Albert Muwalo Nqumayo who was dismissed in 1976 and tried and executed for treason in 1977. Some Jehovah's Witnesses are

imprisoned. The legal and internal security structure by which the government detained more than 2,000 prisoners of conscience before the mass releases of 1977 appears to remain intact.
In late April 1979, Amnesty International received information that 35 people had been hanged during the previous four months.
