Ireland (the Republic of)
There has been a further decrease in political violence and fewer allegations of ill-treatment of suspects by police. No prisoners were adopted.
In October 1978, the government published the report and recommendations of an independent committee that had been set up to advise on safeguards for people in police custody and for the protection of police officers from unfounded allegations of ill-treatment. The committee had been established in October 1977 after Amnesty International had submitted to the government the report of a mission which concluded that people detained on suspicion of politically motivated crimes had been ill-treated by the police during 1975-77 (Amnesty International Report 1978). The committee of inquiry consisted of Mr Justice Barra O'Briain, who was the chairman, Dr Ruaidhri Roberts the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and Mr Patrick Malone, a former commissioner of the Garda Siochana, the Irish police force. The committee was not authorised to investigate individual allegations of ill-treatment, which the government said should be investigated through normal criminal investigation, prosecution and trial. However, the committee took evidence from members of the public, from police, prosecution and other official agencies and from non-governmental organizations, including Amnesty International.
The committee's report made a number of recommendations for changes in procedures for dealing with detained suspects, which the government indicated that it did not accept.
In October 1978, Amnesty International submitted to the government a memorandum which said that the committee of inquiry had put forward important principles regarding the protection of those in police custody and had arrived at carefully considered and practicable safeguards. It urged the government to reconsider its position and to recognize the significance of the committee's work by implementing its recommendations.
