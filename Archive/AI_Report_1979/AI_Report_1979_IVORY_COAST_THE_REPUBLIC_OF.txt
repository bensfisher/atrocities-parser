Ivory Coast (the Republic of)
Political Ufe in the Ivory Coast was unusually turbulent during the year. The effects of inflation and price rises on the standard of living of town dwellers and commercial rivalries between the large expatriate French and Lebanese communities led to increased poUtical tension.
Many arrests took place between July and September 1978 following the distribution of an unsigned tract in Abidjan protesting against increases in fares announced by the government on 1 July 1978. Most of those detained were suspected supporters of Union Nationale des Elèves et Etudiants de la Côte d'Ivoire (UNEECI) which the government claimed was responsible for the tracts. They included a number of university students usually resident in France. Some were deprived of their scholarships, conscripted into the army and placed in military detention centres. In December 1978, Amnesty International appealed to President Félix Houphouët Boigny to ensure that they were charged or released without delay. There was no response.
Further unsigned tracts were distributed in the capital on National Day, 7 December 1978. These warned that the celebrations would be the occasion fora "bloodbath" of the white expatriate community, similar to that which occurred in Kolwezi, Zaire, the previous May, and called for the expulsion of French military forces. No arrests are reported but President Houphouët Boigny announced that a number of "extremist" French technical assistants would be expelled, and that "subversive and fanatical" elements within the Lebanese community would not be allowed to create disorder. Later in December, a number of Abidjan university students were detained allegedly because they refused to participate in the congress of the government approved student organization Mouvement des Elèves et Etudiants de la Côte d'Ivoire (MEECI). Inquiries have not revealed how many remain in prison.
