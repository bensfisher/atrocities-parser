Sierra Leone (the Republic of)
The state of emergency declared on 1 February 1977 was renewed by President Siaka Stevens in February 1978 and again in February 1979 for a further 12 months. The State of Emergency and Public Emergency Regulations permit detention without trial for indefinite periods. In early May 1978, more than 150 people were officially detained, but almost all political detainees were released later that month when the government introduced legislation providing for a one-party state.
Under the one-party state constitution, the ruling party, the All People's Congress (APC), was given institutional power and all other political parties were banned. Twelve members of parliament belonging to the opposition Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) were given the choice between joining the APC within a short period or forfeiting their parliamentary seats. They joined the APC. The new constitution was approved by the House of Representatives in May 1978 and by the public in a referendum in early June 1978.
President Stevens' policy of reconciliation between the government and its former opponents in the SLPP appeared to have been successful and there were no major outbreaks of political violence similar to those of early 1977. Several groups of political detainees whose cases were under investigation by Amnesty International were among more than 130 whose release was announced in May 1978. Ten months later, in March 1979, the government informed Amnesty International that no detainees remained in custody in Freetown.
