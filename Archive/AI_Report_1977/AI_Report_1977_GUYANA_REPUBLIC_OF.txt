Guyana (Republic of)
On 3 February 1977 Amnesty International wrote to the Prime Minister of Guyana, Mr Forbes Burnham, expressing the hope that Arnold Rampersaud, charged with the murder of a policeman in July 1974, would be given a new trial in the very near future. At his first trial, which ended on 2 December 1976, the jury failed to agree on a verdict. At the second trial, which ended on 21 April 1977, the jury was again unable to agree on a verdict. Mr Rampersaud is a member of the opposition People's Progressive Party, which alleges
