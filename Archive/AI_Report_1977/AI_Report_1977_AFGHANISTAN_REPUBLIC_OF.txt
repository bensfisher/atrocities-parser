Afghanistan (Republic of)
On 7 December 1976, the semi-official ii^afeu/Ti'm^i announced that former army general Mir Ahmed Shah and a number of others (another report mentioned 50) were being detained on the charge of plotting to overthrow the Government. This was the third alleged attempt to overthrow the republican Government of President Sardar Mohammed Daud since it replaced the monarchy of King Zahir by a military coup in July 1973. On both previous occasions, in 1973 and 1974, the ringleaders had reportedly been found guilty by a military tribunal and sentenced to death.
In February 1977, the Loyah Jirgah (Grand Assembly) of the Republic elected Sardar Daud as the first President, and unanimously approved a new constitution, which includes Articles forbidding the use of torture and unjust detention. In June 1977, Amnesty International's Secretary General wrote to President Daud welcoming the human rights provisions embodied in the Constitution, but expressing

concern at certain unconfirmed reports of the torture of detainees in Afghanistan and seeking further information about how the human rights provisions of the new Constitution would be implemented. He also requested further details about the use of military tribunals in Afghanistan in cases allegedly involving the national security, and in particular about the precise charges against, and the trial of, Mir Ahmed Shah and his co-defendants. Finally, he expressed concern over the apparent continued use of capital punishment in Afghanistan.
