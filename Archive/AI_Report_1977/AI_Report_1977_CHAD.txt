Chad (Republic of)
Following the seizure of power by General Felix Malloum in April 1975, the human rights situation in Chad improved considerably compared with the situation prevailing under the régime of President Ngapta Tombalbaye. According to available reports, however, some political prisoners remained in detention.
On 26 March 1977, the State Security Court sentenced to death four members of the secessionist National Liberation Front (FRO-LINAT) for their part in the attempted murder of President Malloum on 13 April 1976 during a public ceremony in N'djamena, in which six people were killed and more than 70 injured. On 31 March 1977, Amnesty International cabled the Chadian Head of State, appealing for a commutation of the death sentences passed on Hassan Abakar Adef, Djibrine Aderamane, Idriss Djarma and Mahamat Taher. They were, however, executed on 4 April 1977.
On 6 April 1977, seven soldiers and two civilians were executed by a firing squad; they were allegedly the ringleaders of an abortive coup on 1 April 1977 in which eight people were killed including an army chief of staff. Lieutenant Colonel Ali Dabio.
Amnesty International was relieved to hear of the release on 30 January 1977 of Madame Françoise Claustre after nearly three years of captivity in the hands of rebel Toubou tribesmen in northern Chad. The release of Madame Claustre, together vdth her husband, put an end to a situation in which any possible Amnesty International intervention was impeded by the fact that President Malloum's new Government did not appear to be in a position to influence the rebels and did not wish international organizations to act as mediators.
