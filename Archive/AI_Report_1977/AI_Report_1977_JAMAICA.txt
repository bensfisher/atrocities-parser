Jamaica
In June 1976 a State of Emergency was declared in Jamaica; as a result, it became possible to detain people without charge or trial for an indefinite period. This action was taken in response to what was described by the Prime Minister, Mr Michael Manley, as "a type and scale of violence unique in our history . . . On 7 October 1976 Amnesty Intemationcd wrote to Mr Manley with reference to 174 people detained without trial under the emergency legislation and expressed the hope that "in the very near future all those at present detained will be brought to trial or released".
In April 1977 Amnesty International received a reply from Mr Manley, inviting "a team from Amnesty International [to] visit Jamaica at any time which suits the convenience of your organization to investigate all aspects of human rights in Jamaica. . . ". On 6 June 1977 the State of Emergency was lifted and the last 17 prisoners detained under its provisions were released.
Another cause of concern to Amnesty International in Jamaica is the large number of death sentences. During the year the organization has appealed to the Governor General of Jamaica, The Most Honourable Florizel Glasspole, for the commutation of six death sentences. In May 1977 there were 40 men under sentence of death in St Catherine District Prison, many of whom had been under threat of execution for several years.
Amnesty International has no adopted prisoners in Jamaica.
