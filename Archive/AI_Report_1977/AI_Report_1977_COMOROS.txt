Comoros (The)
The Comorian state consists of the three Indian Ocean islands which unilaterally declared independence from France in July 1975, and it was admitted to the United Nations in November 1975. The fourth island, Mayotte, voted in a referendum in February 1976 to remain a French territory, despite UN and Organization of African Unity (OAU) calls in 1976-1977 to France to end its dependent status. Since April 1976 a number of prominent Comorian politicians have

been detained for allegedly plotting to overthrow Head of State President Ali Soilih, but promises of an early trial have not been fulfilled.
In May 1977, Amnesty International wrote to President Soilih concerning reports of incidents of torture reportedly inflicted on Comorian civilians, particularly on the island of Anjouan, by soldiers under the command of military advisers recruited from various African countries to train the new army. The organization has received no replies to its inquiries and has requested that these reports be fully investigated. A major Comorian problem since December 1976 has been the repatriation and resettlement of an estimated 60,000 Comorians from Madagascar, following the massacre of 21-23 December 1976 {stt Madagascar).
