Burundi (Republic of)
On 1 November 1976 President Michel Micombero was overthrown in a bloodless coup led by the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Burundi Army, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Baptiste Bagaza. The former President, who also came to power as the result of a coup in 1966, was arrested with several of his ministers, but Amnesty International has received no information about possible charges or trials.
The re-constituted Supreme Revolutionary Council consisting of 30 officers led by the new Prime Minister, Lieutenant Colonel Bagaza, promised a "just democratic society" and a commitment to "democratic centralism", based on a revival of the Union et Progrès National {UPRONA—Union and National Progress) party, which would eventually replace the Revolutionary Council.
In early 1977 Amnesty International made inquiries concerning the case of a refugee from Rwanda who was alleged to have been detained without trial and ill-treated. However, the organization leamt of his release in April. Generally, Burundi appears to have settled dovm to a period of relative stability and reconciliation after the massacre and huge exodus of Hutu refugees during 1972.
