Bermuda
In May 1977, Amnesty International appealed to the Acting Governor of Bermuda, Mr George P. Lloyd, for the commutation of death sentences passed on Erskine Burrows and Larry Winfield Tacklyn, both convicted of murder. Bermuda's Committee of Mercy had ruled against the commutation of the sentences, but at the time of writing neither of the men has been executed.
