Switzerland (Swiss Confederation)
In 1976-1977 Amnesty Intemational expressed its concem for imprisoned Conscientious Objectors in Switzerland.
There is a deadlock in the long debate over the establishment of an altemative civil service. This is partly a result of the need to amend Article 18 of the Swiss Constitution, which provides that every male Swiss citizen is obliged to perform military service, and the failure as yet of the two chambers of the Federal Parliament to agree on a compromise draft amendment to the Constitution. If no compromise is reached, the entire reform program will fail. Even if there is agreement, this would have to be submitted to a national referendum and, if the amendment is approved, the earliest date when alternative civil service could be introduced would be 1980.
Two of the three Conscientious Objectors adopted in 1975, René Buchmann and Serge Lenoir, have still not gone to prison to serve their sentences. A lawyer has told Amnesty Intemational that Serge Lenoir will probably not enter prison until 1978 because of the current overcrowding in Swiss military prisons. Jean-Claude Huguenin-Elie was released in June 1976 after serving an eight months' sentence.
René Buchmann and Serge Lenoir are still under adoption. Amnesty Intemational has not adopted any other cases this year.
