An Amnesty Intemational delegation visited Qatar in April. It attended sessions of two political trials and met govemment officials as well as members of the judiciary. Amnesty Intemational was aware that in some individual cases, judges had ordered investigations into allegations of torture. However, Amnesty Intemational urged the government to carry out independent investigations into all such allegations. It also called for the courts to exclude evidence which had been given under duress. Amnesty International recommended that pre-trial procedures at the military camp and at the Mukhabarat (the secret intelligence unit) in Doha, where most detainees said they had been tortured, should be reviewed in order to limit pre-trial incommunicado detention and the attendant risks of torture and ill-treat-ment. In response the government pointed out that Qatar's laws and procedures contained safeguards against torture, but did not specify whether any of the allegations of torture brought to its attention were actually investigated.
Amnesty Intemational urged the govemment to ratify the Intemational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Intemational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Neither treaty had been ratified by the end of the year.
