Suriname
In January 1981 an Amnesty International mission visited Suriname to discuss the organization's concerns with the authorities, in particular the introduction of legislation with retroactive effect and the establishment of a special court for cases of corruptioa Both measures were apparently intended to secure the conviction of former government ministers and officials. Amnesty International later wrote to President Chin A Sen criticizing Decree B-9 and the special court, and referring to allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners (see Amnesty International Report 1981).
On 2 December Amnesty International wrote to Minister of Justice Harvey Naarendorp about allegations that people under interrogation had been ill-treated by military police. Specific reference was made to the cases of Sergeant Wilfred Hawker, Waldi Sedoc and Lloyd Bahalwakhan. At their trial on charges of plotting to overthrow the government they withdrew statements made under interrogation and said that these statements were the result of torture. Amnesty International asked the Minister if any investigation into the allegations had taken place. No response had been received by the end of 1981.
