Djibouti
Amnesty International was concerned by the detention in September 1981 of all 13 members of the executive committee of the newly-formed Parti popu-laire djiboutien (PPD), the Djibouti People's Party, which had sought registration as a legal opposition party in August 1981. They were arrested on 7 September after the PPD published its first bulletin. Those detained included six members of parliament. Among them were two former prime ministers — Ahmed Dini Ahmed and Abdallah Mohamed Kamil — and Mohamed Houmed Mohamed "Souleh", who had been detained and tortured in 1979 after denouncing in the National Assembly the use of torture by the security forces. The President publicly accused them of subversion and anti-state activities, but they were not formally charged. They were held in custody (garde a vue) for longer than the 10 days allowed by law, without reference to the courts. They were detained incommunicado in remote military outposts. Amnesty International appealed for their release as prisoners of conscience.

On 19 October 1981 the constitution was amended by the National Assembly to make the ruling Rassemblement populaire pour le progrès (RPP), the People's Movement for Progress, the only lega! party. This made the PPD illegal. On 25 October 1981 six of the detained PPD members, including Abdallah Mohamed Kamil, were released.
