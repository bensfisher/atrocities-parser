Amnesty International's concerns were the detention and house arrest without trial of political prisoners, and poor prison conditions.
Former President Hamani Diori and former leader of the Sawaba (Freedom) Party Djibo Bakary had been held under house arrest since their release from prison in 1980 and allowed only restricted visits. Hamani Diori, who was placed under house arrest with his son Mounkaila, had been imprisoned since his overthrow in April 1974 by the present head of state, Colonel Seyni Kountche. Djibo Bakary had been detained without trial since 1975 for alleged involvement in an attempted coup.
About 17 people, relatives of Hamani Diori and former officials in his government, remained in detention without charge or trial. They included Hamani Diori's brother, Djiba Balle, and two former government ministers, Aboubacar Moussa and Ibrahima Issa. Three other detainees had been held for more than five years for alleged involvement in plots against the government Cyrille Gabriel and Mai Tourare Gadjo were arrested in 1975 and held without trial; Sanoussi

Jackou was reportedly tried in camera by a military tribunal after his arrest in 1976 but no judgment was made public. Several former officials of the Hamani Diori government were reportedly arrested in late 1980, apparently suspected of links with the Libyan Government At the end of 1981 it was not known whether they were still detained Most of the detainees were held in the remote desert prison at Agadez in the Saharan region, where conditions were reported to be harsh. The remainder were held at Tillabery in southern Niger. Prisoners at Agadez and Tillabery were apparently rarely allowed visits or letters from their families. Medical facilities were also said to be inadequate.
Shortly before the 21 st anniversary of independence on 15 April 1981 Amnesty International appealed to the authorities to bring to trial or release all these detainees. No answer was received.
