Maldives
Amnesty International was concerned about procedures in several trials relating to an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the government of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
The coup attempt which was said to have been uncovered in February 1980 was alleged by government officials to have been master-minded by former President Ibrahim Nasir, living in Singapore. The government arrested and detained a number of people allegedly involved. At the same time members of families associated with the former President, including wives and children, were placed under house arrest
In February 1981 the three alleged leaders of the coup attempt — Ahmed Nasseem, Kuwa Mohamed Maniku and Maisam Ali Maniku — were brought to trial. They were charged with treason, a crime punishable by death under the penal code. On 6 February 1981 Amnesty International appealed to President Gayoom to ensure that trial procedures conformed to internationally recognized standards of fairness. It was informed by the Maldivian Government that it considered that the case involved "planned acts of terrorism". Amnesty International explained on 17 March 1981 that it was concerned that the accused had been held incommunicado for nearly a year before being brought to trial, during which time they might have been subjected to undue pressure; that the accused did not have access to legal counsel during trial proceedings; and that they faced the death

penalty. On 27 April 1981 the defendants were sentenced to hfe imprisonment
