Cameroon
The major concerns of Amnesty International were long-term detention without trial of suspected political opponents of the government, and the poor prison conditions in which they were held.
Throughout 1981 Amnesty International sought the release of the remaining detainees held without charge or trial since July 1976, when some 200 students, teachers and white-collar workers were arrested for allegedly distributing anti-government leaflets. Gaspard Mouen, Martin Ebelle-Tobo, Henri Moukouri, André Moune and Emmanuel Bille were reported to be still in detention. The first three were held at the Centre de rééducation ("Re-education" Centre) at Tchollire, which was believed to be the one prison in Cameroon holding only untried political prisoners or administrative internees. The other two were

held at the Prison de production (labour camp) at Yoko, which has a section for administrative internees. Numerous appeals for the release of these prisoners were made to the authorities throughout the year, but no answer was received. Amnesty International was also concerned by reports that other prisoners were being held without charge or trial, including three army officers arrested in September 1979 after an alleged coup attempt, and at least 20 Jehovah's Witnesses. This religious sect was banned by the government in May 1970.
Amnesty International was concerned by reports that suspects held in custody by the poUce or the paramilitary police, known as the Brigade mixte mobile (BMM), were routinely beaten and ill-treated. Standards of food and hygiene were reported to be very low at both Yaounde central prison and at the "Re-education" Centre at Tchollire. In both prisons detainees only received one meal a day, consisting mainly of millet or cassava. Severe overcrowding was reported in the "disciplinary wing" at Yaounde prison. Both prisons lacked adequate medical facilities, and access to families and friends at TchoUire and Yoko was very restricted.
