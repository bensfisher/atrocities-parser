Portugal
Amnesty International was concerned by the length of the legal proceedings against alleged members of the Partido Revolucionario do Proletariado (PRP), Proletarian Revolutionary Party, some of whom had been in prison since June 1978. In July 1980 the Supreme Court annulled convictions against 24 defendants. The court held that evidence had been admitted by lower courts through procedures that were unconstitutional. {Sqq Amnesty International Report 1980 and 1981.)
In May 1981 Amnesty International's Secretary General met Portuguese officials, including the President, General Antonio dos Santos Ramalho Eanes. They discussed Portugal's actions to observe international human rights standards.
