Deaths in police custody
Osmo Vallo
The commission of inquiry, established by the government to examine the procedures used to investigate the controversial death in May 1995 in police custody of Osmo Vallo, began its work in January. The commission was due to complete its inquiry in 2002. In January Al delegates briefed members of the commission about Al's concerns. In March the Supreme Court rejected the appeal by Osmo Vallo's mother for a new trial of the officers allegedly involved, stating that there was no new evidence to justify it. Peter Andersson
In March the Prosecutor General decided to reopen the preliminary investigation into the death of Peter Andersson because the cause of death had not been
sufficiently investigated. Peter Andersson died on 3 November 2000 in Orebro after being restrained by four policemen during arrest and subsequently in hospital. At the hospital, he was examined by a doctor and then transferred, lying on his stomach, strapped down on a trolley and handcuffed, from the emergency ward to the psychiatric clinic. It was reported that during this transfer one of the officers knelt on his back-Peter Andersson subsequently became lifeless and attempts to resuscitate him failed.
The shooting of Idris Demir
Idris Demir, a 27-year-old Kurdish asylum-seeker, was shot dead by a policeman in Jonkoping on 9 March. Police officers stated that they followed Idris Demir to his apartment to check his driving licence, unaware that he had been ordered to leave Sweden following the rejection of his asylum claim. They alleged that Idris Demir grabbed a knife, held it to his own throat, and threatened to kill himself before running out of the apartment. They claimed that Idris Demir, when confronted by one policeman, attacked the officer with a knife. A second policeman then fired his gun, reportedly in self-defence. However, a friend of Idris Demir who witnessed the killing alleged that Idris Demir did not attack the police, but was shot in the back on his way down the stairs while trying to run away. In May, the Chief Prosecutor in charge of the investigation brought a prosecution against the police officer who shot Idris Demir on two counts: gross assault and causing another person's death. The officer was acquitted by the district court in November.

was carrying out an internal review of the police actions in Gothenburg.
The Prosecutor General decided in October to review a decision taken by the Chief Prosecutor to close the preliminary investigation and not to bring any charges against the officers involved in the shootings-Allegations of ill-treatment It was reported that police used excessive force, including beatings with batons, against demonstrators who were not involved in violent protest. There were also allegations that police officers kicked or beat people with batons after they had been detained and, in some instances, while they were restrained with their hands tied behind their backs and lying down on the ground. Furthermore, it was reported that people were detained arbitrarily without charge, in some instances for many hours, during police actions at two schools, Hvitfeldska and Schillerska. About 150 complaints were lodged against the police and other authorities, including for ill-treatment or illegal detention.
Refugees
Two Egyptian asylum-seekers, Muhammad Muhammad Suleiman Ibrahim El-Zari and Ahmed Hussein Mustafa Kamil Agiza, were forcibly returned to Egypt in December after their asylum claims had been rejected in an unfair procedure. There was concern that in Egypt they would be at grave risk of torture and unfair trial. In addition, Ahmed Hussein Mustafa Kamil Agiza's wife and five children were denied refugee status in Sweden in an unfair procedure and remained at risk of forcible return.
The government recognized both men as having a well-founded fear of persecution, but excluded them from protection on the basis of their alleged connections to organizations which had been responsible for acts of "terrorism". The decision was based on secret evidence provided by the Swedish Security Police which was not disclosed in full to the men and their legal counsel.
The Swedish government held that the men would not be at risk of serious human rights violations in Egypt, on the basis of written guarantees from the Egyptian authorities.
