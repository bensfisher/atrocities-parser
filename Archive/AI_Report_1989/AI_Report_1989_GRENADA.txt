GRENADA
On 8 March the Grenada Court of Appeal began hearing the appeals of 14 members of the former People's Revolutionary Government (PRG) who were sentenced to death in 1986 for the murders of Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop and others and the appeals of three prisoners who had received long prison sentences (see Amnesty International Report 1988). Hearings had not been concluded by the end of the year and, in view of the death of the judge hearing the appeals, further delays were anticipated.
During the year there were new reports of ill-treatment of some of the PRG prisoners. One of them, Leon Cornwall, was alleged to have been severely beaten by prison guards on 4 November when he protested at having been denied a bath and change of clothes for several weeks in October. He was taken to St George's Hospital where he was found to have severe cuts and bruises and a broken rib. Four other prisoners were allegedly beaten after they complained about Leon Cornwall's treatment. They received injuries which in the case of one prisoner, John Ventour, were particularly severe.
Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister Herbert Blaize in December to express concern about these reports and to ask whether an investigation had been carried out.
