Two prisoners were executed in June more than 10 years after their conviction and the courts imposed or upheld an increasing number of death sentences.
Yoshiku Matuda and Kenichi Watanabe were executed in the Osaka Detention Centre in June, although in accordance with government policy there was no official announcement. The two men had been convicted of murder in separate trials in 1975 and 1978.
Ten people were reported to have been sentenced to death by district courts, either for multiple murder or the murder of young people. The Supreme Court confirmed seven death sentences and two prisoners had their applications for retrial rejected. At the end of 1988, some 92 prisoners convicted of murder were reported to be under sentence of death, at least 32 of whom had exhausted all appeals. Their final resort was to apply for clemency. To Amnesty International's knowledge, since 1975 the government has not commuted any death sentence.
In August the retrial of Masao Akahori in the Shizuoka District Court came to an end but by the end of 1988 no verdict had been announced. He had been sentenced to death in 1958 for the kidnapping and murder of a schoolgirl but claimed he had confessed under police duress.
Amnesty International continued to
press for the commutation of all death sentences and to urge the authorities to abolish the death penalty. It made public its concern about the possibility of a miscarriage of justice in the case of Masao Akahori.
