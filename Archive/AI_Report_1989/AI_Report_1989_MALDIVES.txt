In an attempted coup in November, at least 20 people were killed and 80 injured. It was alleged that Abdullah Luthufi and Sagar Ahmed Nasir, both Maldivian businesspeople, had led the coup, supported by dozens of mercenary gunmen believed to belong to a Sri Lankan Tamil group, the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam. The Indian Government sent troops to the Maldives at the request of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, quelling the coup. The conspirators reportedly took 28 hostages when they attempted to escape from the Maldives in hijacked ships. Eight of the hostages were reportedly killed and four went missing.
Following the coup attempt the two leaders and some of their supporters were captured and reportedly beaten by a member of the local security forces and by people in a crowd through which they were led in Male, the capital.
Amnesty International wrote to the government, expressing regret at the loss of life resulting from the coup attempt and urging that prisoners arrested in connection with the incident be protected from ill-treatment. The organization also urged that the prisoners be granted access to lawyers and tried in accordance with international standards. The government
