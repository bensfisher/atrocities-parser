Bulgaria
In June 1974, Dr Heinrich Spetter, a 53-year-old Bulgarian economist of Jewish descent and former United Nations staff member in Vienna, was condemned to death for alleged economic espionage. Amnesty International arranged for Dr Werner Sporn, an Austrian lawyer, to observe his appeal hearing and twice protested to Todor Zhivkov, President of the Bulgarian State Council. Following a worldwide campaign for commutation of the death sentence, the Bulgarian authorities decided suddenly on 22 August 1974 to release Dr Spetter, who is now living in Israel but still waiting for his family to join him. A similar case taken up by AI was that of Solomon Ben-Joseph, a top official in the Bulgarian Ministry of Chemical Industry, punished in August 1974 with a 15-year prison
109
sentence, later reduced on appeal to I IVi years, also for alleged economic espionage.
On 31 October 1974 the Bulgarian Assembly approved an amnesty bill which applied to all Bulgarian citizens who had left the country illegally and who wished to return by the end of 1975. The amnesty law, however, does not affect those who have been deprived of their Bulgarian citizenship, nor those considered "dangerous recidivists".
In April 1975, AI received further details about a dozen imprisoned or banished persons in Bulgaria. Banishment or "compulsory re-settlement" to labour-corrective communities is still being practiced widely in Bulgaria without any judicial interference. Some reports say that banishment can be life-loi^, as in the case of Ivan Sirakov, who was expelled by a police order in January 1968 from his native city Sofia to permanent residence in the remote provincial town of Biala. According to Mr. Sirakov, who succeeded in escaping to Austria in autumn 1974, Biala has a large psychiatric institution where several dissident intellectuals are being kept without any medical justification.
At present AI is working on 12 cases in Bulgaria.
