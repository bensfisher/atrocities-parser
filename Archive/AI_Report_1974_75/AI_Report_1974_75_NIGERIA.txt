Nigeria
During the first half of 1974, Amnesty International groups continued to work on the investigation cases of 13 former members of the Biafran armed forces who had been detained without trial since the end of the Nigerian Civil War in January 1970. Groups were asked to appeal for a general amnesty on 1 October 1974, Nigeria's Independence Day.
In a speech that day, the Nigerian Head of State, General Yakubu Go won, announced that all military detainees would be released. Since that time the Research Department has heard of the release of a number of the investigation case prisoners, although it is believed that the promised amnesty has yet to be implemented fully.
In the speech which announced the impending release of the military detainees, General Gowon retracted a former pledge that his military regime would give way to a civilian government by 1976. This provoked unrest in some political and academic circles in Nigeria, and several critics of the policies of the Federal Military Government were detained without trial under the provisions of the 1967
51
Emergency Regulations. AI adopted these prisoners and the journalists, academics and trade unionists arrested in January and February 1975 following unrest over wage awards to government employees. The use of the emei^ency regulations by the Federal government has come under strong criticism from members of the Nigerian judiciary.
