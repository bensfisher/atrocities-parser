Equatorial Guinea
During 1974-75, Amnesty International received disturbing reports concerning the death of political prisoners and other opponents of the government of President Macias Nguema. In June 1974, between 80 and 100 prisoners in Bata, the capital of the mainland portion of the country, were reported killed after the President alleged that they were plotting against him in prison.
In December 1974 Equatorian exiles in Europe issued a list of 319 persons whom they alleged had been executed since the country gained independence from Spanish colonial rule in 1968. Following the "suicide" of former Vice-President Edmundo Bosio in February 1975, AI Secretary General Martin Ennals appealed to President Macias Nguema to halt atrocities being inflicted on political prisoners in the country.
