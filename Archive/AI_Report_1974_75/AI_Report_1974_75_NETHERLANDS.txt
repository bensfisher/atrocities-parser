Netherlands
A new law on conscientious objection passed in April 1975 now recognizes the right of all Dutch citizens to be exempted from military service for reasons of their conscience, and particularly in connection with Dutch membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). As a resuh, the conscientious objector Kees Vellekoop, who was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment in April 1974, was released in April 1975. He was Amnesty International's only adopted prisoner in the Netherlands.
