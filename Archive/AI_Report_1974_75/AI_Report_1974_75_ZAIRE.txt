Zaire
On 25 November 1974 President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire announced a general amnesty for all political prisoners and political exiles. He told a public gathering that he wished Zaire to be a "country with no prisons". Amnesty International Secretary General Martin Ennals sent a cable of congratulations to the President.
Several exiles have since returned to Zaire although there are unconfirmed reports that at least one prominent exiled politician who returned to Zaire under the amnesty has since been placed under house arrest.
