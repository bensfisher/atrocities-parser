Oman
Murad Abdul Wahab, the only prisoner in Oman for whom an Amnesty International group is working, was previously believed to be imprisoned in Bahrain and was the subject of a postcard campaign in October 1974. However, the Bahraini authorities subsequently informed the International Secretariat that Mr Wahab had been deported to Oman in March 1973, and AI has since regarded him as being a prisoner in Oman.

On July 1974, Secretary General Martin Ennals sent a cable to the ruler of Oman, Sultan Qabus bin Said bin Taimur, appealing for the commutation of a death sentence, and later in July the then Vice-Chairman of AI's British Section, Sir Osmond Williams, visited the Omani Ambassador in London, Nassir El Bualy, to discuss AI's work in relation to Oman.
In January 1975 Mr Ennals wrote to Sultan Qabus about allegations of torture which had been made regarding Oman, in particular about the alleged torture of Sa'ud al-Marzugi, who was subsequently sentenced to death together with three other men in April 1975. Mr Ennals once again appealed to Sultan Qabus for the repeal of the death sentence.
