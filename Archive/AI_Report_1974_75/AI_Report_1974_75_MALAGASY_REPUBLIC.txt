Malagasy Republic
The only two cases in the Malagasy Republic (formerly known as Madagascar) being handled by Amnesty International groupsâ€”both investigation cases-were released early in 1975. However, the International Secretariat has been paying close attention during 1974-75 to the issue of political trials on the island.
Reports late in 1974 said that 60 persons were to be charged with subversion in Tananarive, the Malagasy capital. They included Paul Ramahavita, a former government minister. They were chaiged with forming an organization, the Komity Fivendranan'ny Tanindrana (KFT), allegedly aimed at the overthrow of the military government of General Gabriel Ramanantsoa.
Preparations were going ahead for the dispatch of a mission when, in December
47
1974,	an abortive coup against the Ramanantsoa government took place, plunging the Malagasy Republic into a political crisis. On 25 January 1975 the government of General Ramanantsoa was dissolved, and political power was passed to the Minister of National Defence and Planning, Colonel Wchard Ratsimandrava. On
11 February 1975, Colonel Ratsimandrava was assassinated.
Subsequently rebels who had been beseiged in an army camp on the outskirts of Tananarive since the December coup attempt were crushed by the armed forces, and a new military regime was established under the leadership of General Gilles Andriamahazo. In March 1975 more than 300 persons, including former President Philibert Tsiranana, were brought to trial in Tananarive on charges of complicity in the assassination of Colonel Ratsimandrava. The AI mission, originally scheduled for late 1974, is being reconsidered in the light of these latest developments.
