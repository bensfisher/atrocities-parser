Czechoslovakia
Since the end in 1972 of the much publicized trials of the Dubcek supporters, information on political imprisonment in Czechoslovakia has been difficult to obtain. Most trials take place at district and regional courts and, with few exceptions, receive no publicity. Amnesty International groups are currently working on 16 adoption cases and four investigation cases. In October 1974 Secretary General Martin Ennals protested to the Czechoslovak authorities against the deterioration of prison conditions.
In January, Mr. Ennals cabled Dr Gustav Husak, First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, urging that members of the Kurdish Student Movement in Prague should not be deported to Iraq. In view of the widespread arrests, torture and even execution of Kurds, their lives could be in jeopardy. No deportations to Iraq took place,but Fadil Rash, secretary of the movement, who had been arrested, was expelled from Czechoslovakia to East Berlin.
Two campaigns were launched by Al during the year. In November 1974 national sections sought the release of two prominent supproters of the 1968 reform movement, Jiri MÃ¼ller and Professor Jaroslav Sabata, to mark the third anniversary of their arrests. In April 1975 appeals were made for the release of all prisoners of conscience on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet army. An amnesty was later announced but applied only to criminal prisoners.
Prison conditions continue to cause concern. One particularly harsh feature of the Czechoslovak system is the legal obligation placed on released prisoners to repay the costs of their maintenance while in prison to the state.
