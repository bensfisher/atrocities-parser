Cameroun
While Amnesty International groups continued to work on seven investigation cases and two adoptions in Cameroun during the year 1974-75, a major attempt was made during December 1974 to encourage the granting of a general amnesty for convicted political prisoners and untried detainees in the country. AI hoped that such an amnesty would, if granted, cover a number of categories of prisoners, including the 74 alleged members and supporters of the banned Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), who received prison sentences ranging from 5 years to life at an important political trial which cuhninated in January 1971.
In a letter to President Ahmadou Ahidjo, supported by postcard appeals from AI members throughout the world. Secretary General Martin Ennals called for an amnesty for the convicted UPC prisoners and for untried poUtical prisoners held at "administrative internment camps" at Tcholliré, Yoko, Yaoundé, Douala, Maroua and elsewhere. The appeal for an amnesty received some support in the Camerounian press, and in May 1975, news reached the Research Department that up to 50 prisoners had been freed in an amnesty, including Monsignor Ndongmo, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nkongsamba, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.

Following the arrest in January 1974 of the Secretary General of the Union Générale des Travailleurs Centrafricains Jean-Richard Sandos and his deputy J.B. Malikanga, Amnesty International groups adopted both men. Mr Sandos was released in August 1974 but subsequently re-arrested in January 1975. Group work continues on both the cases.
