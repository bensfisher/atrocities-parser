Venezuela
Amnesty International groups are at present investigating two cases in Venezuela. Both are peasants detained for alleged collaboration with guerrilla groups; both are held under military justice. Three peasants adopted in 1973 were released in late 1974 after AI adoption groups exchanged cables and letters with Venezuelan officials, including President Carlos Andrés Pérez who took office in March 1974. The released prisoners had been held without trial under military law, charged with military rebeUion. One of the three, Simón José Gil, was detained in January 1969, and released after almost five years' detention without trial.
AI has received considerable information on torture and maltreatment in Venezuela prior to 1974, but there have been no more recent allegations.
In November 1974 AI received information on over 100 prisoners held in Venezuela for political reasons. Most are held for alleged guerrilla activity. Almost all of these prisoners are held under military justice,charged with military rebellion, and were detained between 1968 and 1973. Many alleged severe torture by both military and civilian security agencies. Only a small percentage have been tried. A number of political prisoners sentenced to long prison terms for military rebellion were released in early 1975.
