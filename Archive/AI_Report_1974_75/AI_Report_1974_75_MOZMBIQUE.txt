Mozambique
In September 1974, Portuguese authorities handed over political control in Mozambique to the unified liberation movement Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO).
Although a general amnesty for political prisoners in Mozambique was granted soon after the Portuguese coup d'Ã©tat in April 1974, a considerable number of people have been detained by FRELIMO since then. Many of those arrested are presently being held at a FRELIMO-run camp in southern Tanzania, where they have been seen twice by journalists. Samora Machel, President of FRELIMO, gave a public undertaking that the prisoners would not be maltreated and stated that it was FRELIMO's intention to rehabilitate them into Mozambique society.
In June 1975 Amnesty International sent a representative to Mozambique to discuss the continuing detention of these prisoners and to request that a general amnesty be granted to mark the achievement of independence on 25 June 1975.
