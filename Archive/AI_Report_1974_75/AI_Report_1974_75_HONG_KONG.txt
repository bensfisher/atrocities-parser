Hong Kong
In December 1974, the Hong Kong government decided to send back to the People's RepubUc of China Chinese nationals caught entering the colony without

permission. In January 1975 Amnesty International Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote to British Foreign Secretary James Callaghan to ask what steps the Hong Kong government had taken to ascertain beforehand whether these individuals would face punishment on their return, and whether an attempt had been made, once the decision to deport had been taken, to find alternative countries of residence.
In reply, Under Secretary of State Lord Goronwy-Roberts asserted that "each case is quickly but carefully examined...and full account is taken of any special circumstance or genuine hardship". However, the principles on which the screening procedures and assessment of each case were based remained unclear. Lord Goronwy-Roberts also maintained that going to Hong Kong illegally would normally be regarded by the Chinese authorities as a civil misdemeanour, not calling for penal correctives, although no evidence was given on this point. As for third countries of residence, those possessing valid entry permits would "probably" be permitted to travel onwards, but Hong Kong would not and could not become a general clearing-house.
