Mali
Amnesty International groups continued their adoption work for 38 prisoners detained without trial since the overthrow of Mali's last civilian government by a military coup in November 1968. In August 1974, AI adopted 14 other persons who had been arrested two months earlier for circulating a pamphlet in Bamako, the Malien capital, criticizing a constitutional referendum which had been organized by the ruling Conseil Militaire de Libération National (CMLN). In April
1975,	these prisoners were brought to trial in Bamako and received prison terms.
In November 1974, AI launched a concerted campaign for a general amnesty
for all political prisoners in Mali, focused on the sixth aimiversary of the accession to power of the CMLN. One month after the campaign. President Moussa Traoré annoiinreH that 1975 would be a year of national reconciliation, which would see

the release of the political detainees.
AI groups then urged the CMLN to include Al-adopted prisoners in this overall amnesty. On 2 June 1975,15 political prisoners were riîleased, presumably as part of the amnesty. They included associates of former President Modibo Keita whose government was overthrown in the 1968 coup. All those released were AI adoptees.
