Guinea
Amnesty International groups continued to work on two investigation cases in Guinea; individuals held since 1971 and 1972 without being chained or brought to trial. AI is still concerned at the reportedly large numbers of prisoners held in Guinea, but lack of firm information and the sensitivity of the situation in Guinea precluded large scale work on this country during the past 12 months.
