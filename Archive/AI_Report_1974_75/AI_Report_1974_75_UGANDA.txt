Uganda
Consistent reports of violations of human rights and flouting of the rule of law continue to reach Amnesty International regarding Uganda, where the major problem continues to be the "disappearance" of opponents of the government of President Idi Amin, rather than political imprisonment as such.
Following a report by AI in May 1974 on political murders in Uganda and a well-documented study of the breakdown of the rule of law in that country by the International Commission of Jurists the following month, the Ugandan government set up a commission of inquiry to look into the "disappearances" of Ugandans since General Amin seized power in January 1971.
Meanwhile reports of politically-motivated killings continued. In November 1974,15 members of the Ugandan armed forces were reportedly killed in a revolt against the Amin government. Two months later the international press reported that up to 600 Ugandans had been massacred near the eastern Ugandan town of Moroto.
In March 1975 General Amin introduced a decree stipulating the death sentence by firing squad for economic crimes such as embezzlement, smuggling and corruption, thus raising the possibility that public executions, such as those which took place in Uganda early in 1973, might be revived. On 1 April 1975, the Ugandan authorities arrested a British university lecturer, Denis Hills. He was charged with treason and sentenced to public execution by a military tribunal in June 1975. AI cabled the Organization of African Unity and several African heads of state, asking them to appeal to President Amin for clemency for Mr Hills.
After postponing the execution briefly during an unsuccessful conciliation attempt by two British government emissaries, General Amin announced during a visit to Zaire at the end of June that he had decided to spare the life of Mr Hills following mediation by his host, President Mobuto Sese Seko.
