Nicaragua
A state of martial law was imposed following a guerrilla action in December 1974, in which members of the Nicaraguan government and diplomatic corps, largely relatives of President Anastasio Somoza, were held hostage. Amnesty International received many reports of arbitrary arrests, torture and disappearances related to the Nicaraguan government's subsequent action against guerrilla movements and sympathizers. In February 1975, Secretary General Martin Ennals wrote to President Somoza to express AI's concern over suspension of basic human rights under martial law.
