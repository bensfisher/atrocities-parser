Bahrain
In August 1974, Amnesty International Secretary General Martin Ennals appealed to the ruler of Bahrain, Sheikh Issa bin Sulman AI Khalifa, to release 29 trade unionists who had been arrested in June 1974, following worker strikes. A news release was issued to this effect. All 29 were subsequently adopted by AI groups, and of these only three are now still in prison.
Apart from these three, for whom AI groups are still working, the Research Department knows of only seven other political prisoners in Bahrain.
