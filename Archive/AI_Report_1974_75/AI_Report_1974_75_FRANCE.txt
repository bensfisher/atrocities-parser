Amnesty International's attention in France has been focused mainly on conscientious objectors, of whom eight more were adopted and seven released in 1974-75. A further 20 are being investigated. The presidential amnesty of 16 July applied only in part to conscientious objectors, with the effect that the majority of those sentenced remained in prison.
For the first lime there were manifestations of political action within the ranks of conscripts.

There has also been a steady flow of information about prison conditions in France and in her overseas territories. On 15 May 1975, AI Secretary General Martin Ennals sent a letter of appeal to President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing in which he asked for the release of three Tahitian pacifists, imprisoned three years ago for their opposition to nuclear tests in French Polynesia.
