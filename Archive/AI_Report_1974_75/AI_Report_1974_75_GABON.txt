Gabon
Nine investigation cases continued to be handled by Amnesty International groups during 1974-75. The prisoners, who include teachers, students, and civil servants, were arrested between July and October 1972 and have been held since that time without being brought to trial. In February 1975 AI Secretary General Martin Ennals appealed to President Omar Bongo of Gabon to release the prisoners as part of a general amnesty. This initiative was supported by a postcard campaign by AI groups which have adopted prisoners in a number of French-speaking African states. During June 1975 the Research Department received reports of an amnesty, declared in the previous month, which freed over 300 prisoners. Further details of this measure are now being sought.
