People's Democratic Republic of Yemen
Work has continued for 10 Amnesty International adopted prisoners in the country, and the cases of three others were taken up during the year, including the case of Tawfiq 'Az'azi, a barrister from Aden who disappeared from his fiat in the summer of 1972 and has not been heard of since.
There are continuing reports of people disappearing or being executed, but the

fragmentary nature of much of the material makes it difficult to substantiate these reports.
There were reports that a large number of political prisoners, including some of those adopted by AI, were released following the National Front Party Congress in March 1975, but no details of these releases have yet been received.
In May 1975 an AI mission visited the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Yemen Arab Republic. The delegates were British lawyer John Platts-Mills and Katrina Mortimer from the Research Department. They met the Chairman of the Presidentail Council, Salem Rubia Ali, and officials in the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Justice and discussed with them the problem of political imprisonment, prison conditions, detention without trial, disappearances and executions. The delegates also visited AI Mansura prison and met those Al-adopted prisoners held there. They were not, however, permitted to visit any other prisons in the country.
