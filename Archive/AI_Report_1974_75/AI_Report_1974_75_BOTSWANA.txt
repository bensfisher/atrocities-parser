Botswana
Amnesty International has been particularly concerned throughout the year about the situation of South African and Rhodesian refugees in Botswana. Their number increased during the last months of 1974 when, following the arrest of many officials of the South African Students' Organization and the Black Peoples' Convention in South Africa, approximately 35 young supporters of those organizations took refuge in Botswana. The International Secretariat has been in contact with the Botswana government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees regarding the status and security against repatriation afforded to this latest group of refugees, some of whom were formerly detained or barmed in South Africa. AI is presently considering a scheme for the provision of relief assistance.
The vulnerability of refugees in Botswana was vividly demonstrated during 1974. In October, Ethan Dube, an official of the Zimbabwe African Peoples' Union (ZAPU) and a Rhodesian national, was forcibly abducted from Francistown. Reports suggest that Mr Dube was kidnapped by members of the Rhodesian security forces although the Rhodesian government has denied any involvement in the affair.
