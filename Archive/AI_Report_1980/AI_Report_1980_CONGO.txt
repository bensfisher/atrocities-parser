Congo
The year was one of consolidation and reorganization in the ruling military committee of the Parti congolais du travail CPCT), Congolese Labour Party, after the replacement of President Joachim Yhombi-Opango in February 1979 by Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso. It was widely expected in the Congo that after Joachim Yhombi-Opango's arrest in March 1979 he would soon be brought to trial on charges of treason, corruption and embezzlement but by the end of April 1980 no date had been set for the trial and no formal charges had been brought against him. In December 1979 Amnesty International expressed its

concern to the government that Joachim Yhombi-Opango had been held for nine months without trial, and its hope that his trial would be fair and open and held before an independent tribunal.
Amnesty International repeatedly appealed for the release of detainees held in connection with an alleged conspiracy in August 1978 and of prisoners tried and sentenced in 1977 in connection with the assassination of President Ngouabi. On 14 August 1979, shortly after his investiture, President Sassou-Nguesso granted an amnesty to all these prisoners. They included the former Prime Minister, Pascal Lissouba. Many were reinstated in their former positions.
