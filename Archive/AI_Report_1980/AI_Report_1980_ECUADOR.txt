Ecuador
A general political amnesty marked the return to civilian rule after almost eight years of military administrations. President Jaime Ro√≠dos was elected in April 1979 and assumed office on August 1979. Although Amnesty International welcomed the proclamation of a general amnesty, not all the political prisoners arrested during the former military administration were released.
More than 100 students and trade unionists were arrested during public protests against price rises in January 1980. All were released within several days.
