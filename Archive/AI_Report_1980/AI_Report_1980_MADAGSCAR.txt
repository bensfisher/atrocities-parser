Madagascar
Amnesty International was concerned about the prolonged pre-trial detention of three Malagasy officers, who have been detained incommunicado since October 1977. The detained officers are Commandant Richard Andriamaholison, former Minister of Information in Colonel Ratsimandrava's government, army captain Marson Rakotinirina, and Captain Jean Rakoto-Abel. They were charged with plotting against the security of the state but by April 1980 no notice of their trial had been given. Amnesty International took up their cases for investigation because it believed that they could be prisoners of conscience detained for their political views.
Two other cases of prolonged pre-trial detention being investigated by Amnesty International were those of Milan Knezic (also known as Kristo Milanovic), a Yugoslav refugee, and Dimitar Valev Dimitrov, a Bulgarian refugee. They were detained in March 1978, after their arrival in Madagascar without the necessary travel documents, publicly accused of being mercenaries and charged with offences against the security of the state. For the first five months of detention they were held incommunicado at the Direction générale de documentation intérieure et extérieure (DGDIE), security headquarters, in Ambohibao, a suburb of the capital Antananarivo.
A number of people, including foreigners, were also reported detained without any legal recourse by the DGDIE or held for investigation in prolonged pre-trial detention.
Amnesty International received several allegations of torture at the DGDIE headquarters. The director of DGDIE is Colonel Bien-Aimé Raveloson-Mahasampa. Amnesty International also sought to confirm reports of the poor prison conditions in which sentenced common-law prisoners and some untried detainees were held, in Antananarivo civil prison, provincial prisons, and on Nosy Lava prison island.
