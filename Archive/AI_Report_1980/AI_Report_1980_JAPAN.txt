Amnesty Intemational has continued to be concerned about the use of the death penalty as a punishment for a number of criminal offences. At the time of writing, 19 people were known to be on death row, one of them since 1950. During the year, an unknown number of death sentences were passed; others were confirmed by the Supreme Court, but to the knowledge of Amnesty International none was commuted The exact number of executions is not known because such information is not published by the authorities. Amnesty International urged the authorities to declare a moratorium on executions pending the abolition of the death penalty.
On 21 June 1979 Japan ratified the Intemational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
