Guyana
In July 1979 Drs Walter Rodney, Rupert Roopnarine and Omawale, leading members of the opposition Working People's Alliance, were charged with arson after the destruction by fire of a government ministry and offices of the ruling People's National Congress party. Amnesty International arranged for an observer to attend the trial, which was postponed several times as a result of the application by the defence for the case to be heard by a jury rather than by a magistrate alone. The Administration of Justice Act 1977 removed the automatic right to trial by jury in certain cases.
On 25 February 1980 Edward Dublin, also a member of the Working People's Alliance, was killed by police, who alleged that he had been caught in the act of stealing sacks of cement and had resisted arrest After receiving reports of the killing which stressed that Edward Dublin was unarmed and that eye-witness accounts did not support the police version, Amnesty International wrote to Prime

Minister Forbes Bumham asking whether any invesigation into the killing had taken place and, if so, requesting to be informed of the findings. By April 1980 no reply had been received. Amnesty International continues to monitor events in Guyana.
