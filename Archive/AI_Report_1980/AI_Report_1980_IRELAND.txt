Ireland
During tile year Amnesty International had no adopted prisoners of conscience in the Republic of Ireland. There was no pattern of allegations of police ill-treatment of suspects, as in previous years, although recommendations made by an independent committee of inquiry had been rejected by the Irish Government. This committee, which the government had set up after an Amnesty Intemational submission on ill-treatment of suspects detained by the police, had put forward what Amnesty International believes were carefully considered and practicable safeguards.
Amnesty Intemational is concemed about the refusal of the government to introduce these safeguards. Another concern is the continuing operation of a Special Criminal Court, which sits with three judges but without a jury, and which was set up specifically to try cases of politically motivated crimes affectingthe security of the state. In its 1977 submission to the government, Amnesty International concluded that the non-jury court "has seemingly failed or refused to scrutinize allegations of maltreatment according to the principles of law which govern the burden of proof with regard to the admissibility of statements". In April 1980 it sent an observer to the appeal hearing of Osgur Breatnach, a member of the Irish Republican Socialist Party who was convicted of armed robbery in the Special Criminal Court Its concern about this case arose from reports that Osgur Breatnach was convicted solely on the basis of a confession which he alleges he made as a result of ill-treatment by the police while he was held incommunicado for a prolonged period in police custody.
