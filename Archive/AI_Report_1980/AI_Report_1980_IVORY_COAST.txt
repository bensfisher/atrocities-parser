Ivory Coast
The distribution of leaflets protesting against increases in urban transport fares led to the arrest of 12 students in August 1978. The students were suspected supporters of the banned Union nationale des èleves et étudiants de la Côte-d'Ivoire (UNEECI), the National Union of Pupils and Students of the Ivory Coast, which the government claimed was responsible for the protest. After their arrest, the students' scholarships were revoked and they were forcibly conscripted. This measure, carried out without any legal procedure, had been used in the past as a form of punishment. The conscripts are subjected to a special regime of hardship, involving physical exercise to the point of exhaustion, and leave is refused for the entire period of military service. In June 1979 Amnesty International publicly appealed to the Government of the Ivory Coast to release the students. On 25 September 1979 they were freed and returned to their studies.
