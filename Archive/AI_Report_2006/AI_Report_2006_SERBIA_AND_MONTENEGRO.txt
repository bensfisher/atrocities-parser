Background
Serbia and Montenegro (SCO) continued to operate with separate governments and legal systems. On 3 October the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers authorized the European Council to start talks with the Union of SCO. These started on 7 November aimed at a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. In October, a revised criminal code and a law on the police and on the Protector of Citizens (ombudsperson) were Introduced, but legislative reform remained slow. The EU, through the Venice Commission, set out conditions for the Montenegrin independence referendum planned for April 2006.
The UN Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) continued to administer Kosovo. Some further competencies were transferred to the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG), and measures were taken towards decentralization. The presence of uniformed opposition groups was reported. The Self-Determlnation Movement organized non-violent demonstrations against UNMIK in which at least 186 people were arrested; some were reportedly ill-treated by the police. In October, the UN Secretary-General appointed a Special Envoy to Kosovo to conduct talks on the future status of the province.
War crimes: international prosecutions
The trial by the Tribunal of former President Slobodan Milosevic, accused of responsibility for war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH), and Kosovo, continued- In June the prosecution presented the court with footage of members of a Serb paramilitary unit (the "Scorpions") executing six Bosniak prisoners from Srebrenica on Mount Treskavlca in BiH in July 1995. The "Scorpions" were alleged to be under the control of the Serbian authorities when the crimes were committed. In December, the Tribunal amended the indictment against Jovica Stanisic and Franko Simatovic to include further charges related to this incident. Proceedings also opened on 20 December at the Belgrade war crimes court against five members of the "Scorpions" in relation to these executions.
The Serbian authorities failed to seek out and arrest suspects Indicted by the Tribunal. However, under pressure from the EU and the US government, they adopted a policy of "encouraging" voluntary surrender and affording suspects official support.
In January, former commander of the Pristina Corps Vladimir Lazarevic surrendered to the Serbian authorities; he was transferred to the custody of the
Tribunal. He had been indicted along with three other former senior officers and government officials for individual criminal responsibility and for command responsibility for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war in Kosovo in 1999. Two others - Sreten Luklc, former police general in Kosovo and later assistant Serbian Interior Minister, and Nebojsa Pavkovic, former commander of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia-voluntarily surrendered in April and May. The fourth man, Vlastimlr Djordevic, former Assistant Minister of the Interior, was believed to remain at large in Russia-
Be tween February and April, eight suspects indicted by the Tribunal for charges including war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in connection with the war in BiH, surrendered to the Serbian authorities and were transferred to the Tribunal- They included former Bosnian Serb Army officers Drago Nikolic, Vlnko Pandurevlc, Ljubomir Borovcanin and Vujadin Popovic, all of whom were Indicted in connection with the killing of more than 8,000 Bosniak civilians in Srebenica in July 1995 (see Bosnia and Herzegovina entry).

In April another suspect, Dejan "Bagsy" Malenkovic, was extradited from Greece and in July was given witness-associate status (became a prosecution witness) by the court. Police torture and ill-treatment Reports of police torture or ill-treatment apparently fell, but investigations into previous cases remained seriously flawed, and in a number of trials testimony allegedly obtained under torture was admitted in evidence. In May a Ministry of Interior report confirmed six cases of torture during "Operation Sabre" in 2003, although the Ministry was reportedly unable to identify the police officers concerned.
The UN Committee against Torture in both May and November found SCG to be in violation of the Convention against Torture in relation to complaints submitted on behalf of two Romani men, Jovica Dimitrov and Danilo Dimitrijevic.

There was increasing concern about the independence of the media. Few perpetrators were brought to justice.

'Disappearances' and abductions
In April, a mass grave, reportedly containing the remains of non-Albanians killed in 1998, was found in Klina.

According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), 426 people were charged with criminal offences in connection with the March 2004 violence in which 19 people died and 954 civilians and 184 police and security personnel were injured. As of November, some 209 people had been convicted and 12 acquitted, with 110 cases still pending and 95 charges dropped.

On 2 June, UNMIK submitted a report to the Council of Europe on measures taken to implement the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. This failed to note that internally displaced Roma, Ashkali and "Egyptian" people living near the former Trepca Mines lead-smelting site in Zvecan (ZveÃ§an) municipality had been found by the WHO in 2004 to have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. There was grave concern at the failure of UNMIK and the PISG to respect and fulfil their right to health; despite international calls for their urgent relocation, they had not been moved by the end of the year.
Trafficking of women and girls for forced prostitution
An Administrative Directive implementing the 2001 trafficking regulation promulgated in February failed to guarantee trafficked women and girls an automatic right to protection and assistance. A trafficking action plan published in May failed to fully meet Al's 2004 recommendations on protecting the human rights of trafficked women and girls.
Arrests of groups of suspected traffickers were reported in March and May, Q In May a senior member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees was convicted and sentenced for sexual exploitation of minors under 16 years, but charges related to trafficking were dropped.
