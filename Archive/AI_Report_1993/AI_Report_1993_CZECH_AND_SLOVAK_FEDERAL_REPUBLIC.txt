CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC
Police officers allegedly ill-treated members of the Roma community, and spectators at a football match.
The Civic Democratic Party and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won elections in June for the Federal Assembly and two republican parliaments. Vaclav Klaus became Prime Minister of the Czech Republic and Vladimir MeCiar, whose party campaigned for an independent Slovakia, became Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic. In July President Vaclav Havel failed to be re-elected as President by the Federal Assembly when Slovak parliamentarians did not give him a majority in their side of the Upper Chamber. Two weeks
later when the Slovak National Council adopted a Declaration of Sovereignty, he submitted his resignation. Three subsequent attempts failed to elect a new President.
Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir MeCiar agreed in August that the Czech and Slovak Federation should split into two separate states by 1 January 1993. A constitutional amendment to this effect was adopted by the Federal Assembly in November. The two states would preserve economic ties through a customs and monetary union.
In March the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and its Sixth Protocol which provides for the abolition of the death penalty for peacetime offences. It declared that it recognized both the right of individual petition to and the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.
In May police officers in Eastern Slovakia reportedly ill-treated members of the Roma community. Following a dispute in a bar, a police officer and two other people assaulted FrantiSek OraCko, a Rom from LomniCka. That night 40 police officers went to LomniCka and broke into the house where FrantiSek OraCko lived together with 20 other people. The poUce allegedly beat everyone there indiscriminately with truncheons and shouted: "All of you will die. Heil Hitler! All Gypsies are to be shot." Ludovita OraCka, a 10-year-old child, was reportedly held by the neck by a police officer and thrown against the wall. Some other children who crawled under a bed were dragged out and thrown on to the floor. Anna OraCkova, who was ill in bed, was forcibly removed from her bed by

police and put on the floor. Ludovit OraCko Sr was kicked in the head and beaten. FrantiSek Oraiko, Ludovit OraCko Sr, Ludovit OraCko Jr and Martin Mirga were taken into custody. They were reportedly beaten in the car on the way to the police station.
In Septembor, follovring disturbances at a football match in Bratislava, it was alleged that the police beat scores of spectators with truncheons, including some not involved in the disturbances. At least 16 people required hospital treatment for injuries resulting from police beatings.
Amnesty International called for a full and impartial investigation into the alleged torture and ill-treatment of Roma in LomniCka and for those responsible to be brought to justice. It also asked the Slovak authorities whether a full and impartial investigation had been carried out into the use of force by the police at Bratislava football stadium, xu'ging them to establish procedures which would prevent ill-treatment in such situations.
In November the Slovak authorities denied that members of the Roma community in LomniCka had been ill-treated. An investigation reportedly concluded that police used force only to apprehend criminal offenders. Amnesty International asked the Slovak authorities for full details of the investigation.
