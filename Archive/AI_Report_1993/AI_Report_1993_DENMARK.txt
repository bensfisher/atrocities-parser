DENMARK
The government published in March the report of a judicial inquiry into the treatÂ« ment of asylum-seekers in prisons in Copenhagen, the capital. The report included the inquiry's findings into allegations of ill-treatment made by two foreign visitors.
Babading Fatty and Himid Hassan Juma both alleged that they had been ill-treated by prison guards in 1990 while in custody (see Amnesty International Report 1992). The inquiry found that the treatment of the two detainees was mistaken, largely on account of the police officers' relative youth, inexperience and lack of training. In the case of Himid Hassan Juma, the police officer responsible for the case had had an insufficient knowledge of the basic regulations governing arrest procedures.
In the case of Babading Fatty the inquiry
accepted that the detainee had experienced both physical and mental distress while in custody, but rejected any assertion that he had been deliberately ill-treated in order to frighten him, or that his treatment had been an expression of racial discrimination.
The report expressed concern about the degree of force which had been used in both cases to restrain the detainees but it did not accept that it constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
Amnesty International wrote to the government in August expressing concern that the report had not accepted that the force used against the detainees constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The organization noted that ill-treatment of a detainee can qualify as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment whether or not that treatment is deliberate or intended to frighten or coerce the detainee.
