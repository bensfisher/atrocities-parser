BRUNEI DARUSSALAM
Three suspected government opponents detained without trial since 1990 were released.
The authorities informed Amnesty International in October that three political prisoners - Garip bin Timpus, Garip bin Mangool and Omar bin Tamin - had been released. The date of release was not given. The three had been held in the Jerudong Detention Centre ander the Internal Security Enactment of 1982, which allows for indefinite detention without charge or trial (see Amnesty International Report 1992). The authorities did not make public the reasons for their detention but it appeared that they were suspected of having links with the Partai Rakyat Brunei (prb), Brunei People's Party. The prb was banned after an abortive armed rebellion in 1962.
The authorities also informed Amnesty International in October that all restrictions imposed at the time of his release in March 1990 on Abdul Latif Chuchu, a former prisoner of conscience, had been lifted in March 1991. Amnesty International welcomed the releases of the three political detainees and the lifting of all restrictions on Abdul Latif Chuchu.
