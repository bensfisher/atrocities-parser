There were concerns for the health of Phyllis Coard, the only female prisoner in Richmond Hill Prison, who had spent much of the past six years in solitary confinement. No new death sentences were passed and there were no executions.
Phyllis Coard, one of 14 former members of the People's Revolutionary Government whose death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment in 1991 (see Amnesty International Report 1992), was reportedly suffering from severe depression and in August began a hunger-strike. Later that month, the Prison Commissioner reportedly expressed concern that she might be suicidal and two prison doctors recommended that she be examined by a qualified outside psychiatrist. Such treatment was withheld, however, until October, when she was allowed to see a psychiatrist of her choice. She then ended her hunger-strike.
There had been reports of the deteriorating health of Phyllis Coard for a number of years, owing in part to the long periods she had spent in solitary confinement since 1983 (see Amnesty International Reports 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1991). However, her prison conditions improved in 1992 and, according to the authorities, she was allowed to work daily with other inmates, attend communal religious services and participate in games and occasional cultural events.
