ST CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS
Two prisoners scheduled to be hanged in what would have been the first executions since 1985 were granted stays of execution.
Two men sentenced to death in 1991 for
st christopher and nevis/saudi arabia
murder were scheduled to be executed on 7 February. The day before, on 6 February, Bernard Richards and Ronald Browne were granted stays of execution. An appeal had been lodged against the dismissal of a constitutional motion that their rights under Article 7 of the Constitution (forbidding torture or inhuman or degrading punishment) would be violated if they were executed. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in September. An appeal lodged in March in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (jcpc) in London, the final court of appeal for St Christopher and Nevis, was pending a hearing at the end of the year.
Amnesty hiternational wrote to the Governor General, Sir Clement Arrindell, and the Prime Minister, Dr Kennedy Simmonds, in January. It stressed that the resumption of executions after seven years would be a retrograde step for human rights and urged the government to commute all death sentences. It urged the government to provide maximum safeguards for all prisoners facing possible death sentences. It expressed concern that the two men had not had the opportunity to submit their cases to the jcpc. It feared that they may have been unaware that they could appeal to the jcpc or that they could request financial assistance to pursue such an appeal.
Amnesty International welcomed the stays of execution and reiterated its call for the commutation of all death sentences.
