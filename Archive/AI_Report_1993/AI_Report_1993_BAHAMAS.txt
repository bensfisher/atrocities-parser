At least two people were sentenced to death; there were no executions. At the end of the year some 25 people were on death row.
The Free National Movement won the general election in August, replacing the People's Liberation Party which had been in power for 25 years. The manifesto of Hubert Ingraham, the new Prime Minister, included a commitment to promote and protect human rights and to consider the United Nations human rights covenants "with a view to early ratification",
Cyril James Darville was sentenced to death in August for a murder committed in March 1990. Michelle Woodside was sentenced to death in November for a murder committed in October 1991.
In February the Supreme Court dismissed a motion challenging the constitutionality of executions (see Amnesty International Report 1992). An appeal lodged in the Court of Appeal was still pending at the end of the year. Executions remained suspended pending a final decision on this appeal.
Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister Ingraham in September to express its concern about the death penalty and corporal punishment. It urged the government to commute all current death sentences, abolish the death penalty and repeal legislation allowing for the use of corporal punishment, including flogging. A reply from the Prime Minister's Office in October stated that "the issues raised ... are under consideration by the appropriate policy making bodies".
