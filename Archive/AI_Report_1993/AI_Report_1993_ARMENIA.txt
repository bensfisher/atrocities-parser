ARMENIA
The death penalty was abolished for two offences. The status of three prisoners sentenced to death in 1990 remained unclear.
Armenia gained independence after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Headed by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia joined the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in January and became a member of the United Nations in March.
The political situation continued to be
influenced by armed conflict in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, situated in the neighbouring republic of Azerbaydzhan but populated mainly by ethnic Armenians. Parliament postponed discussion of a draft law which would have provided a civilian alternative to military service for conscientious objectors, although no one was known to have been imprisoned for refusing call-up on these grounds during the year.
In March, for the first time, the authorities provided Amnesty International with statistics on the recent use of the death penalty. In 1989 four people were sentenced to death: in subsequent years two had their sentences commuted and two were executed. Three people sentenced to death in 1990 were still awaiting the outcome of petitions for clemency in May and their status was unclear at the end of the year. On 11 May parliament abolished the death penalty for two economic offences: "violation of rules for currency transactions" and "large-scale theft of state and social property".
Amnesty International urged that the three death sentences be commuted, and that parliament consider the total abolition of the death penalty,
Following allegations of hostage-taking, ill-treatment and deliberate and arbitrary killing of non-combatant civilians by ethnic Armenian paramilitary forces in Nagorno-Karabakh (see Azerbaydzhan entry), the organization also urged the authorities to exert all influence possible to ensure that international human rights and humanitarian principles were observed by all those associated with the conflict.
