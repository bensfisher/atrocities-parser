QATAR
Four advocates of multi-party democracy were detained for periods of between five days and three months. All were believed to be prisoners of conscience.
'Issa Shahin al-Ghanim and Mohammad Salih al-Kowari were arrested in July and held in incommunicado detention, apparently without charge or trial, in Doha Central Prison. They were released in September and October respectively. They were among a group of 53 people who had signed a petition to the Amir of Qatar, al-Shaikh Khalifa Ibn Hamad Al-Thani, in late December 1991 seeking free parliamentary elections, a written constitution and the expansion of personal and political freedoms. Two other signatories were also held: Abd al-Latif Mohammad al-Nu'aymi, an official in the Ministry of Oil and Finance, was detained for five days in March; and Rashed Lamloum al-Musaifri was detained for 14 days in April.
Prior to their arrest in July, Mohammad Salih al-Kowari and issa Shahin ai-Ghanim were reportedly prevented from leaving the country and had their passports confiscated in May. They were arrested after sending a petition of protest to the authorities. Both had also reportedly refused to withdraw their signature from the December 1991 petition.
Amnesty International expressed concern about the arrests to the Amir of Qatar and called for the immediate and unconditional release of the prisoners of conscience.
