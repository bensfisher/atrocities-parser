BOTSWANA
Government ofUcials allegedly tortured members of the Basarwa (Bushman) ethnic group who were detained unlawfully for poaching.
The Basarwa are the aboriginal inhabitants of large areas of Botswana and other parts of southern Africa. Their economy is based on hunting and gathering and they are socially disadvantaged compared with the majority Batswana, who are settled agriculturalists.
In March the Botswana Christian Council reported that Basarwa men who were alleged to have poached wild animals had been victims of widespread torture by officials of the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (dwnp). The officials were said to have routinely placed a rubber ring tightly around each prisoner's testicles and
a plastic bag over the head. The pain would cause the victim to excrete involuntarily and the prisoner would then be beaten. It was alleged that Basarwa arrested by dwnp officials were detained without charge, unlawfully, for periods of up to two weeks, before being brought before a magistrate and charged with poaching.
In September Amnesty International wrote to the authorities calling for an independent investigation into allegations of torture and unlawful detention of Basarwa and for those responsible to be brought to justice. The government replied in November, saying that investigations had been held but had found no evidence of discrimination or torture against Basarwa.
