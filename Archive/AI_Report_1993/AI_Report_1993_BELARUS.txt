BELARUS
Belarus retained the death penalty for 16 peacetime ofTences. Twenty-four people were sentenced to death. Three death sentences were commuted and 28 people were executed.
Belarus became an independent state, headed by Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The country, already a member of the United Nations, joined the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in January.
By the end of the year parliament had still not debated proposed revisions to the criminal code which would reduce the scope of the death penalty to four offences: premeditated, aggravated murder; aggravated rape; kidnapping of a child; and acts of terrorism with aggravated circumstances.
Twenty-four people were sentenced to death during the year and 28 executions were carried out. Three death sentences were commuted. All death sentences and executions were believed to be for premeditated, aggravated murder.
Amnesty International repeatedly urged the authorities to take steps towards abolition of the death penalty, and to impose a moratorium on death sentences and executions.
