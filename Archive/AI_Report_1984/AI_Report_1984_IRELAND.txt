November and December 1982 to express concern about the standards applied in the case regarding the acceptance of confessions in evidence in the face of complaints that they had been made after physical ill-treatment and prolonged, exhaustive questioning (see Amnesty International Report 1983).
The office of the Minister of Justice replied in February 1983 that in the absence of new evidence it would not interfere in the decisions taken by the courts in the case.
In May 1983 an Amnesty International delegate went to Ireland to gather further information on the case. On 19 May Amnesty International asked the Minister of Justice for a meeting to discuss the case. The Minister's office replied that the Minister would not meet an Amnesty International delegatioa
In June Amnesty International sent a detailed letter to the government outlining its concerns. Amnesty International expressed appreciation for the position of respect for the courts enunciated by the government, but said that doubts remained about the fairness of Mr Kelly's conviction. Amnesty International urged the government to take remedial action. The organization subsequently published its letter to the government.
