Amnesty Intemational was concemed about the continued detention of eight people who had been held without trial for their alleged involvement in the rebellion of December 1962. Most had been held continu-ously since their arrest at that time imder Emergency Orders issued in connection with the rebelUon. Amnesty Intemational was also concemed about the detention without trial of approximately 20 other people arrested for political reasons during the 1970s who were also being held under the Emergency Orders.
The eight detainees arrested in connection with the 1962 rebellion were reg^ed by Amnesty Intemational as prisoners of conscience. Following the defeat of the rebellion, launched by the Partai Rakyat Brunei (PRB), Brunei People's Party, about 2,500 members of the party and its military wing, the Tentera Nasional Kalimantan Utara (TT^U), North Kalimantan National Army, were arrested. By the beginning of 1982, all but the eight detainees mentioned above had either been released, had escaped or had died in detention. Amnesty Intemational believed that the eight remaining detainees, none of whom was prominent in the PRB or the TNKU, continued to be detained not for their alleged role in the 1962 rebellion but as a general deterrent to political activity in the territory. Amnesty Intemational was also concemed that several of the detainees had reached advanced years and that their detention in virtual isolation without regular visits or correspondence was a danger to their well-being.
On 4 January 1983, Amnesty Intemational wrote to the Sultan of Brunei expressing its concem about the situation of the detainees and appealing for their release. In September 1983, it initiated action to secure the release of the eight detainees and on 8 September 1983 submitted a statement to the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization presenting its information on the detainees.
