Korea (Democratic People's Republic of)
Amnesty Intemational's work on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), North Korea, continued to be seriously impaired by the absence of any official information during the year conceming any arrests, trials, or death sentences. Nor was any information on these subjects published in the intemational press.
Amnesty Intemational continued to investigate reports that four prominent political figures, Pak Kimi-chol, Kim Chang-bong, Ryu Chang-shik and Li Yong-mu, have been detained for several years (see Amnesty Intemational Report 1983). Continued inquiries to the DPRK govemment about their reported detention failed to elicit any response.

In June 198 3 it was reported in the Japanese press that 1,090 people had been "purged" between January and April for opposing the growing political power of Kim Chong-il, son of President IGm Il-sung. It was thought diat some of these people may have been detained.
