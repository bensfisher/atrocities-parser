There were reports of torture and ill-treatment by police officers. Prison conditions were harsh. The death penalty continued to be imposed, but no executions were carried out.
Torture/ ill-treatment
There were reports of torture and ill-treatment by police during arrest and interrogation. At the end of 2000 local non-governmental organizations were pursuing at least three cases of alleged torture of criminal suspects through the courts.
Prison conditions
Prison conditions were poor and in some cases there were concerns that they could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. There were particular concerns about juvenile offenders who were held in youth wings of adult prisons. A report by a nongovernmental organization, commissioned in 1999 by the commissioner of prisons, documented cases of sexual violence against juveniles by adult prisoners, sometimes with the involvement of prison wardens.
Death penalty
At least 53 people were sentenced to death in 2000. No prisoners were known to have been executed since 1994. President Bakili Muluzi, who had publicly stated his opposition to the death penalty, had so far commuted all death sentences,
