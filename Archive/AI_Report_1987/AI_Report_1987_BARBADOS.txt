Barbados
Amnesty International wrote to the government in December about two prisoners under sentence of death. Patrick Greaves and Michael Taylor were convicted in October 1984 of a murder committed in March of the same year. Both were
17	years old at the time of the crime. Their convictions and death sentences were upheld on 18 November 1986 by the Barbados Court of Appeal. Amnesty International called on the government to bring Barbadian law into line with international treaties and guidelines prohibiting the imposition of death sentences on people aged under
18	at the time of the crime. It also urged the government to commute, the death sentences passed on Patrick Greaves and Michael Taylor.
The last executions in Barbados took place in 1984 when three men were hanged. Amnesty International believed that about 17 prisoners were under sentence of death at the end of 1986.
