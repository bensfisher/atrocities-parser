The 'Grenada 17'
In June the Truth and Reconciliation Commission presented its report to Parliament. According to reports, the Commission called for "an appropriate opportunity for the 'Grenada 17' to access existing or established courts... which would studiously ensure the process of fair trial." The "Grenada 17" were convicted in 1986 following unfair trials of the murder of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and others in 1983. During the trial the defendants alleged that some of the statements used in evidence against them had been obtained under torture and there were serious concerns about the possible bias of Judicial officials and Jurors involved in the case. The Commission also called for efforts to be made to find the bodies of those who died during the coup and US invasion and to pay compensation to their families. The government had failed to take any steps to implement the Commission's recommendations by the end of the year.
In December the UK Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Grenada's highest court of appeal, heard a constitutional motion presented by the 13 members of the "Grenada 17" who remained in prison challenging The constitutionality and fairness of their detention. A decision was expected in early 2007. Three of the "Grenada 17" - Andy Mitchell, Vincent Joseph and Cosmos Richardson—were released in December after completing 20 years in prison. Their sentences had been reduced to 20 years for good behaviour. Phyllis Coard had been released in 2000 for health reasons.
Threats, attacks and intimidation against human rights defenders, in particular those focusing on economic, social and cultural rights, intensified. Large numbers of women continued to be killed, with few successful prosecutions ofthe perpetrators. There was some progress in bringing to justice some of those responsible for human rights violations committed during the internal armed conflict.
Background
There were continued high levels of crime, affecting all sectors of society
Various groups protested against different government economic policies. February saw protests against the Central America Free Trade Agreement. In June, doctors protested against under-investment in health services and infrastructure. Some rural Indigenous communities continued to oppose mining activities in their areas.
In February, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guatemala issued its first report. Among other recommendations it called for more investment to prevent human rights violations and protect human rights.
Constitutional guarantees were suspended twice during the year in certain rural areas as combined army and police forces searched for alleged weapons caches and crops producing illegal drugs. Civil society groups protested against the manner of the searches and accused them of being politically motivated, as communities in the targeted areas had protested against government policies.
In October, a Mexican court authorized the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who left the presidency in January 2004, to face charges of corruption. An appeal was lodged.
In December the government signed an agreement with the UN to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The Commission would support the Public Prosecutor's Office in prosecuting the activities of illegal security forces and clandestine security organizations. The agreement was not submitted to Congress for ratification by the end of the year.
Violence against women
At least 580 women were killed, according to police records. According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, during 2006, six people were sentenced for such killings, which often involved sexual violence.
In June, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed concern at

the disappearances, rape, torture and murders of women and the engrained culture of impunity for such crimes. In September, Congress approved the creation of a new National Institute of Forensic Sciences which would unify the forensic services of different government bodies. A law which considered sexual relations with a female minor a crime only if the girl was "honest" remained in force. Q In February, the body of Silvia Patricia Madrid, a 25-year-old sex-worker, was found semi-naked on a road on the outskirts of Guatemala City. She had been strangled and her body showed signs of sexual violence. The authorities did not collect evidence from the alleged murder scene.
Economic, social and cultural rights
According to the UN, over 30 per cent of the population lived on less than US$2 a day. Inequality persisted in the country. A disproportionately high number of those with low incomes and limited access to healthcare and education were women. Indigenous people and rural dwellers-
Evictions in rural areas continued, with 29 reported to have been carried out. In July the UN Committee against Torture called for the government to prevent the use of excessive force, provide specific training for police officers, and ensure that complaints concerning forced evictions were thoroughly investigated. Q In April, approximately 400 people of the San José La Moca farm, Department of Alta Verapaz, were forcibly evicted. The community had been in dispute with the farm's owner over alleged unpaid wages. They were forced onto a nearby road, with no access to clean water, food or shelter. In July, one member of the community was killed and 38 wounded in further violence related to the eviction.
Threats, intimidation and impunity •
During a visit in May, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that there had been no significant progress in combating impunity or eliminating clandestine groups. More than half of the reported 278 attacks on human rights activists and organizations were against those focusing on economic, social and cultural rights, including labour rights, the rights of Indigenous peoples and housing rights,
InJune a Spanish judge and prosecutor, investigating a case of alleged genocide, visited the country to interview witnesses and suspects. The two officials were prevented from pursuing the case, but in July the judge issued international arrest warrants for the five accused, including former President General Efrain Ríos Montt.
Q In July, Erwin Orrego, a member of the Emergency Front of Market SeJlers of Guatemala, was kidnapped and threatened with execution, allegedly by police officers. He was released after human rights organizations alerted the media and authorities.
Death penalty
A proposal to abolish the death penalty was rejected after the relevant commission in Congress returned an
unfavourable verdict. Two new proposals to establish a system for allowing pardons of those sentenced to death progressed through Congress, In 2005 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (lACHR) had ruled that the lack of possibility of a pardon meant that the death sentences could not be carried out.
Nine prisoners had their death sentences commuted to 50-year prison terms after judgments by the lACHR relating to the definition of crimes for which the death penalty could be applied. Twenty-one prisoners remained under sentence of death. No death sentences were passed during the year and no executions took place,
