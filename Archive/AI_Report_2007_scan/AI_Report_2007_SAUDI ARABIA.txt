About 2,000 demonstrators in various cities protested against the Israeli bombardment of Lebanon in July and August. Several people were arrested but all were believed to have been released without charge.
Some of 300 members of the Ismaili Shi'a community were briefly arrested in September when they held a protest in Nijran against the continuing detention of other Ismailis, who had been detained in connection with demonstrations and clashes in April 2000. Following this, some of the remaining Ismaili prisoners were released, but others were still believed to be held at the end of 2006.
Abuses in the context of the 'war on terror'
The government continued to pursue its stated policy of fighting terrorism, often paying little regard to international law.
Clashes between security forces and armed groups continued in various parts of the country, including Abqiq, Riyadh and Jeddah. At least five men on the government's list of suspected al-Qa'ida militants were reportedly killed in a rest house in February during clashes with security forces in al-Yarmuk district, Riyadh.
The Minister of Interior announced in April that a State Security Court would be introduced to investigate and try alleged terror suspects and supporters of terrorism but it was not clear whether this had been established by the end of 2006. In June the King said that those who handed themselves in to the authorities would benefit from an amnesty and be pardoned for their actions.
Scores of people suspected of links to al-Qa'ida were arrested. At least 100, including foreign nationals, were reportedly arrested in March, June and August alone in Mecca, Madinah and Riyadh.
The authorities did not disclose the names, legal status or other details of those arrested in 2006 and in previous years, and it was not known whether any of them were charged or brought to trial. Q Fouad Hakim, who was reportedly arrested in December 2004 for suspected links to an "extremist organization", was believed to have been detained without charge or trial, and without access to a lawyer until he was released from al-Ruwais prison, Jeddah, in November,

The Minister of Interior reportedly announced in April that thousands of detainees had been released, including 700 men linked to al-Qa'ida who the authorities had "involved in a programme aimed at correcting their extremist views". He did not disclose when or over what period these releases had occurred.
Cuantanamo Bay detainees
At least two dozen Saudi Arabian nationals and an ethnic Uighur who had been detained by US forces in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were repatriated to Saudi Arabia in May and June. They were detained upon arrival and held at al-Ha'ir prison. There were fears that Siddeq Ahmad Siddeq Hour Turkistani, the Uighur, would be at risk of torture or execution if he were to be removed to China; he was.still believed to be in Saudi Arabia at the end of 2006. The Saudi Arabian authorities said that the Investigation and Public Prosecution Commission would review the cases of the returned detainees, and at least 12 of them were released in May and August. Some were said to have been released for lack of evidence of any offence; others were sentenced to one-year prison terms for document forgery.

She had been accused of defaming Saudi Arabian society and misinterpreting verses of the Qur'an. The Ministry of Culture and Information did not permit her book or some 20 others to be featured at the Riyadh International Book Fair, because they were considered defamatory to Saudi Arabia and Islam.
Scores of people, including pro-reform figures, were subjected to travel bans after their release from detention. Dr Matroukal-Falih and Muhammad Sa'eed Tayyeb, who were arrested in 2004 for calling for reform, reportedly remained subject to restrictions on their freedom of expression and movement imposed when they were released in August 2005, and March 2004, respectively.

He was apparently arrested because of a speech he gave at the Sudanese Embassy in which he criticized the Sudanese government. He was deported to Sudan, where he was arrested immediately and held incommunicado, on 28 September.
