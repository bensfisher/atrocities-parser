Political prisoners
At least 31 prisoners sentenced for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government in 1996 remained in prison. They had been convicted after an unfair trial in 1999. Allegations that they were tortured or ill-treated in pretrial detention were never adequately investigated. Eighteen remained under sentence of death and at least 13 others were serving prison terms.
Torture and ill-treatment
The UN Committee against Torture examined Qatar's implementation of the Convention against Torture in May. The Committee welcomed Qatar's report but expressed concern that Qatari legislation fails to define torture in accordance with international standards and that arrest and detention procedures placed suspects at increased risk of torture, particularly the lack of access to a lawyer or independent doctor or any requirement that the authorities notify a detainee's relatives of the arrest.
Deprival of nationality
At least 2,000 people, many of them members of the al-Ghufran branch of the al-Murra tribe, continued to be denied Qatari nationality by the authorities. They were formally deprived of Qatari nationality in 2004 and 2005 on the grounds that they held Saudi Arabian nationality, although they denied this. In March, the authorities announced that they were carrying out a review of such cases and by the end of the year some 4,000 others were believed to have had their nationality reinstated. In at least some cases, however, Qatari authorities were alleged to have amended individuals' birth records to state that they were born in Saudi Arabia, so rendering them ineligible to participate in elections in Qatar. & 'Abdullah Hussein 'Ali Ahmed al-MaIki was believed not to have had his Qatari nationality restored by the end of the year His nationality was revoked soon after he criticized the Qatari authorities in comments broadcast on the al-Jazeera satellite television station in May 2005,
Violence against women

The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Qatari authorities implement international obligations related to human trafficking, create an office of National Coordinator on Human Trafficking, and take steps to introduce mechanisms which would ensure that victims of trafficking were properly identified and treated.
