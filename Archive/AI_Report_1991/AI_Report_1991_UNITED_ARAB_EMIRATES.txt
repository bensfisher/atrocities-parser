A possible prisoner of conscience held since 1987 was released. At least one person was sentenced to be lashed in public as a judicial punishment.
Mahmud Sulaiman 'Abdi, a 16-year-old Somali national who was arrested in 1987, apparently in connection with his father's political activities (see Amnesty International Report 1990), was released in mid-January after spending more than two years in prison. He was never charged or tried.
In September it was reported that a Pakistani national, 'Ala' al-Din Sulaiman, had been sentenced to 80 lashes after being convicted of drunkenness and other charges. It is not known whether the sentence was carried out. Two youths sentenced to 550 lashes each for drunkenness in 1989 (see Amnesty International Report 1990) were reported to have appealed against their sentences, which were not known to have been carried out by the end of the year.
Asylum-seekers from countries including Iran, Somalia and Uganda were allegedly threatened with involuntary return to their countries of origin where they might become prisoners of conscience or face torture or execution. However, no cases of such involuntary return were recorded.
Amnesty International wrote to the government to urge that sentences of judicial

punishment constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, such as flogging, be commuted, and that such punishments be replaced with more humane penalties. The organization also appealed on behalf of asylum-seekers believed to be in danger of involuntary return to countries where they might become prisoners of conscience, or face torture or execution.
