Seven prisoners of conscience, four of whom had been held since 1962, were released. Criminal offenders continued to be sentenced to mandatory whippings which constitute a cruel, inhuman or degrading form of punishment.
After spending 27 years in prison without charge or trial, Sarponin bin Sarpo, Suhaili bin Badas, Tinggal bin Muhammad and Baha bin Mohammed were released in January, along with Sheikh Nikman bin Sheikh Mahmud who had been held without trial for 14 years. The first four were detained soon after an abortive armed rebellion staged in December 1962 by the Partai Rakyat Brunei (prb), Brunei People's Party, against the then Sultan. The fifth. Sheikh Nikman. who was not a member of the prb, was apparently held because he was the brother of the prb president-in-exile.
Abdul Latif Hamid and Abdul Latif Chuchu, who had been the leaders of the Brunei National Democratic Party, were conditionally released in March. They had been detained without charge or trial since January 1988 apparently for advocating parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy. Their conditions of release included staying indoors between 10pm and 6am, not leaving their district without police permission, and not engaging in any political activity for one year. Abdul Latif Hamid died of asthma in May. His death did not appear to be related to his detention.

In January Amnesty International wrote to the government welcoming the release of five prisoners of conscience and urging the release of the two others. In April Amnesty International welcomed their release but urged the government to lift the restrictions imposed on them.
