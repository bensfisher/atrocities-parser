An amendment to the Criminal Code, which came into force in November 1989. extended the use of the death penalty to people who were over the age of 16 at the time of the offence; previously the minimum age was 18.
Amnesty hitemational wrote to Prime Minister James Mitchell in April expressing concem at the new provision, pointing out that it contravened international standards which strictly prohibit death sentences being passed on people under the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Amnesty International urged the government to repeal the provision and to seriously consider abolishing the death penalty. Amnesty International also requested the commutation of all outstanding death sentences.
In an oral statement delivered in August to the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, Amnesty International included reference to its concem about the introduction of the death penalty for juveniles.
