SÀO TOMÉ AND PRINCIPE
The death penalty was abolished under a new constitution which also increased protection for fundamental rights and freedoms. All political prisoners were released.
The new constitution came into force in September after it was approved by a refer-endxun in August. It abolished the death penalty in law. No one had been sentenced to death since the penalty was introduced in 1979 for the offence of "mercenarism", or being a mercenary. Substantially increased protection for prisoners includes a prohibition on torture and the right to chal-
lenge the legality of a detention through habeas corpus procedures. The Constitution also guarantees freedom of expression and association, and introduced the right to form or join political parties. Three new political parties were formed to contest legislative and presidential elections in 1991.
All 39 political prisoners were released. They had been convicted in September 1989 of armed rebellion and endangering the security of the state but had no right to appeal to a higher court against their convictions or sentences (see Amnesty Internationa! Report 1990). Three were released in March after completing their two-year sentences, which ran from the date of their arrest in 1988; the others were released in April on the orders of President Manuel Pinto da Costa.
Amnesty International welcomed the abolition of the death penalty and the increased human rights safeguards in the new constitution.
