BAHAMAS
Four prisoners were scheduled for execution but were granted stays. At the end of the year some 21 people were under sentence of death. No executions were carried out in 1990; the last execution took place in 1986.
The executions of four prisoners convicted of murder, set for 21 and 28 August, were stayed. Romain Shephard was granted a stay after he indicated his intention to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which acts as the final court of appeal for the Bahamas. Peter Meadows, Arnold Heastie and Nikita Hamilton were granted stays of execution pending a decision on a constitutional motion in a separate case. The motion
argued that it would be unconstitutional to execute anyone in the Bahamas because the method of execution was not specified in the Constitution or any law. The motion was still pending a hearing at the end of the year.
Amnesty International wrote to Prime Minister Lynden Pindling in November expressing concem that death warrants had been issued in August for the execution of the four prisoners and, furthermore, that this action had been taken when a decision was pending on a constitutional challenge to the death penalty. The letter welcomed the stays of execution and urged the government not to issue new death warrants. It also urged the government to commute all death sentences and to take other steps to abolish the death penalty.
