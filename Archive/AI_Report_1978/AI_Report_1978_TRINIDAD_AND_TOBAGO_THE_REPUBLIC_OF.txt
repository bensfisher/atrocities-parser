Trinidad and Tobago (the Republic of)
A Caribbean seminar on the abolition of the death penalty, held in Trinidad on 7 and 8 November 1977, was co-sponsored jointly by the Caribbean Human Rights and Legal Aid Company, the Trinidad and Tobago National Committee for the Abolition of the Death Penalty and Amnesty International (see section on Death Penalty Program). The researcher for the English-speaking Caribbean in the International Secretariat of Amnesty International attended the seminar.
While in Trinidad she visited Andy Thomas, one of more than twenty people under sentence of death for murder. In June 1978, an Urgent Action was initiated on behalf of Stanley Abbott, Boodram Bedassie and Julien Marshall, all three sentenced to death for murder, who had exhausted their legal appeals. At the time of writing, they had not been executed. Two executions have taken place in Trinidad during the past year.
