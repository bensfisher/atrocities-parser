Bermuda
Following reports on 26 November 1977 that Erskine Durrant Burrows and Larry Winfield Tacklyn were to be executed on 2 December (see Amnesty International Report 1977) Amnesty International appealed to the Governor, Sir Peter Rams-botham, to commute the sentences and to the Prime Minister, Mr David Gibbons, to do everything possible to prevent the executions taking place. Because Bermuda is a British colony, an appeal was also made to Dr David Owen, the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Erskine Durrant Burrows had been convicted in 1976 of the murders of Police Commissioner George Duckett and the island's Governor, Sir Richard Sharpies. He was also convicted, with Larry Winfield Tacklyn, of the murder of two supermarket owners. The two men were executed on 2 December, the first executions to take place in Bermuda for 34 years.
Both the executed men were Black, and the murders for which they were convicted appear to have been politically motivated. The executions brought to the surface racial tension which had been latent in Bermuda and were followed by riots; these in turn led to the declaration by the Governor of a State of Emergency and the dispatch to the island of British troops.
