Dominica
The case of Desmond Trotter, sentenced to death in 1974 for the murder of an American tourist, has been the focus of Amnesty International activity on Dominica over the past year. Desmond Trotter was reprieved in April 1976 and his sentence commuted to life imprisonment, following the retraction of testimony by the chief prosecution witness. Amnesty International believes that there are sufficient doubts about the case to justify a retrial. Desmond Trotter, who is a member of a group known as "The Dreads", has always maintained that he is innocent and that his political activities were the reason for his arrest and conviction.
