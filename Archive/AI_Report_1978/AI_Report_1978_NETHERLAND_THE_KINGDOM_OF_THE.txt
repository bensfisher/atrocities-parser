On 13 March 1978, Amnesty International wrote to Professor Job de Ruiter, the Minister of Justice in the Netherlands, giving its views on the conditions of detention of three Red Army Fraction prisoners in the Netherlands.
The three prisoners - Knut Folkerts and Christoph Wackernagel, detained in Maastricht, and Gerd Schneider, detained in Scheveningen - had been held in solitary confinement since their arrest and had been on hunger strike for improved conditions for six weeks. Knut Folkerts was already serving a twenty-year sentence for murdering a Dutch policeman and seriously wounding another during his arrest in Utrecht in September 1977. Gerd Schneider and Christoph Wackernagel were arrested after a gun battle in Amsterdam in November 1977. All three were also facing extradition to the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) on charges relating to the murders in the FRG of Hans Martin Schleyer, the kidnapped industrialist, and Siegfried Buback, the Federal Public Prosecutor, besides other offences.
In its letter, Amnesty International said that prolonged isolation is likely to have a detrimental effect on the mental and physical health of any individual, and that, as a rule, it constitutes cruel and inhuman treatment.
