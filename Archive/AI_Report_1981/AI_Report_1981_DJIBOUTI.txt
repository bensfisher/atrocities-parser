Djibouti
Amnesty International's concerns in Djibouti centred on the cases of 41 people arrested in 1979. They were detained on charges of being involved in two separate attacks on army camps at Randa and at Khor Angar. Most are believed to have been tortured immediately after their arrest. Nineteen of the detainees were discharged and freed in early 1981, and others who had earlier been provisionally released were also discharged at the same time. The remaining 22 detainees went on trial before the state security tribunal in March 1981.
The two trials relating to the Randa and Khor Angar incidents resulted in the acquittal and release of 15 of the defendants. Seven — mostly soldiers — were sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from three to seven years on the lesser charge of criminal association. No charge relating to actual participation in the attacks was sustained. There is no right of appeal against the tribunal's verdict or sentence. The counsel of the defendants' choice, a member of the Paris Bar, was

not permitted to plead, but the defendants were represented by lawyers of the Djibouti Bar.
Amnesty Intemational's concem over the treatment of the detainees arrested after the Randa and Khor Angar incidents had been brought to the attention of President Hassan Gouled's government during an Amnesty International mission to Djibouti in March 1980. Particular disquiet had been expressed about the alleged torture of the detainees, many of whom appeared to have been arrested because of their previous membership of a banned opposition party.
