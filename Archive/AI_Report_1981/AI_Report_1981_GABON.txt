Amnesty International's major concern was detention without trial.
Dominique Diata and Augustin Irigo, two soldiers held without charge or trial for more than two years and adopted as prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International, were released in June 1980. They had been arrested in March 1978 apparently suspected of left-wing sympathies.
In January 1981 Amnesty International learned of the arrest of Guy Ossito Midiouhouan, a teacher of Beninese nationality. He was apparently detained for several weeks because he had written an unpublished article containing comments held to be insulting to President Omar Bongo, and is beheved to have been ill-treated. On 6 February 1981 Amnesty International asked the authorities for the reasons for his arrest and on 16 February 1981 they replied that he had been expelled to Togo, where, according to independent reports, he was again arrested. His wife and child who had been placed under house arrest after his detention were also expelled from Gabon. He was later deported from Togo to Benin.

In February 1981 it was reported that the government intended to increase the penalty for criticizing or insulting the head of state or other senior government officials. Those convicted may in future be liable to up to 10 years' imprisonment.
Reports received by Amnesty International suggested that significant numbers of detainees were being held without charge or trial at Libreville central prison. The identities of most were not known to Amnesty International, but they appeared to include both political and criminal suspects, many of them victims of arbitrary arrest Unable to obtain release by legal means, as a result some are believed to have been imprisoned under harsh conditions for several years.
