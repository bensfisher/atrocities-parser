Burma
Amnesty International's concerns were political imprisonment and the ill-treatment of detainees. Although some political detainees have been released, Amnesty International continued to receive reports of ill-treatment and torture which have proved difficult to substantiate. The government of General Ne Win enforced strict censorship and observers were not allowed into the country.
On 28 May 1980 the government proclaimed an amnesty stating that no action would be taken against "those engaged in insurrection against the State" for offences committed earlier, if they returned "to the legal fold" within 90 days. The amnesty applied to political and criminal prisoners.
A considerable number of political opponents of the government took advantage of this amnesty. Some had been in exile and others had associated with insurgent groups within Burma. Amongst those who returned from exile abroad was U Nu, the former Prime Minister, whose government was overthrown in a coup by General Ne Win in 1962.
Amnesty Intemational received reports that all those detained in mass arrests during former United Nations Secretary-General U Thant's funeral in December 1974, and student demonstrations in June 1975, were released. Also released under the amnesty was Thakin Soe, former Chairman of the Burmese Communist Party's "Red Flag" faction, whose death sentence had been confirmed on 19 March 1974 by the State Council and who had been held on death row ever since. Some 4,000 political prisoners were reportedly released under the amnesty.
Many of the allegations of arrests and ill-treatment of political detainees concerned minority peoples such as the Karens and the Rohingya Muslims of Arakan. Amnesty International was investigating reports that Htun Myint Kyu, the former Secretary-General of the Burma Muslim Organization, had once more been arrested and held in detention.
