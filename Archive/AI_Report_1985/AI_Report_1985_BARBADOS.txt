Three prisoners were hanged on 10 October, the first executions to be carried out for two years.
On 25 October Amnesty International wrote to the Prime Minister expressing its regret at the executions, emphasizing the inhumanity of the death penalty as punishment, its arbitrariness and its failure to deter crime. Amnesty International urged the government to put abolition of the death penalty before parliament. The Prime Minister replied in November stating that, although he personally opposed the death penalty, he could not initiate steps to abolish it at present because it had strong public support.
