Amnesty International was concerned about the use of the death penalty. Three prisoners convicted of murder were executed during 1984. A fourth person was sentenced to death but was not believed to have been executedby the end ofthe year.
Clement Gofhamodimo was convicted of murder by the High Court in January. His appeal was heard in May but rejected in late June. His case-like all those of prisoners under sentence of death - was reviewed by the Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, comprising the President, Vice-President, Attorney-General and a doctor. However, the committee did not recommend clemency and Clement Gofhamodimo was hanged on 27 October. Amnesty International appealed for clemency after his death sentence was imposed and again after his appeal for clemency was rejected
Amnesty International made a similar appeal in July on behalf of Lovemore Sibanda when it learned that the Appeal Court had upheld his conviction for murder, and the death sentence. However, he and Lesenyo Kgeresi, also convicted of murder, were reportedly executed in September.
Amnesty International received reports of one other prisoner under sentence of death, but by the end of 1984 had not learned the outcome of his appeal.
