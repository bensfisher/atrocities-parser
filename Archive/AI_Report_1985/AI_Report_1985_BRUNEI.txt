Brunei
Amnesty International was concemed about the continued detention of eight adopted prisoners of conscience held without trial for 14 to 21 years under Emergency Orders for alleged involvement in an armed revolt of December 1962 (see Amnesty Intemational Report 1984). Several of them had reached advanced years and Amnesty International believed that their detention in virtual isolation without regular visits or correspondence was a danger to their well-being. Amnesty Intemational submitted information on them under the UN procedure for confidentially reviewing communications about human rights violations, urging the UN to take steps to redress the violations. On 4 January and on 10 December Amnesty Intemational appealed to the Sultan of Brunei for their release but received no reply.
Amnesty Intemational was also concemed about the detention without trial of about 20 others arrested for political reasons, mostly between 1975 and 1978. Although the accusations against them were not made public, several had previously been imprisoned on charges of involvement in the 1962 revolt, and one prisoner was reportedly detained after sending letters to the Sultan complaining about cormption in the royal family. On 1 January, when Brunei became fully independent under the formal name Bmnei Damssalam, three detainees who had been held under the Emergency Orders for up to eight years were released. According to a press report from Brunei, these were the first political prisoners to be released since 1978.
Although no death sentences or executions were reported during 1984, it was reported in December that the death penalty had been extended to certain drug-trafficking offences.
