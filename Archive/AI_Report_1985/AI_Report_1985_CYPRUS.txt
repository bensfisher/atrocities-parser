Cyprus
Amnesty Intemational was concemed that Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned for refusing on conscientious grounds to perform military service.
No right to conscientious objection to military service is recognized in Cypriot law and all men between the ages of 18 and 50 are liable to conscrip-tioa Police officers, priests and men of the Armenian Orthodox, Catholic and Maronite religions are, however, exempted Those who do not respond to call-up are considered to be deserters and can be sentenced to up to two years' imprisonment
In all cases known to Amnesty Intemational conscientious objectors were granted some remission of sentence for good behaviour, but after release were again called up for military service and when they did not respond were again charged. Amnesty Intemational was informed during 1984 of several Jehovah's Witnesses serving second and third sentences because of their continued refusal to respond
During the year Amnesty Intemational adopted as prisoners of conscience 60 Jehovah's Witnesses imprisoned for conscientious objection, nine of whom were still in prison at the end of 1984. Most of those who were released were again called up and charged when they did not comply.
On 31 May Amnesty Intemational wrote to President Spyros Kyprianou welcoming the abolition of the death penalty in Cypms for all but exceptional offences such as wartime crimes. The organization expressed the hope that this encouraging move would be a step towards the total abolition of the death penalty.
