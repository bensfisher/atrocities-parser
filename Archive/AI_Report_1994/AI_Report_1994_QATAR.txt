QATAR
Two prisoners of conscience were arrested and held without trial for several weeks.
M.V. Babu and Samuel Philip, both Indian nationals, were arrested in Doha in lanuary, reportedly after holding a Christian prayer meeting in a private house. Such meetings are illegal under Qatari law.
Amnesty International expressed concern about the arrest and detention of the two men to the Minister of the Interior in the government headed by the Amir of Qatar, al-Shaikh Khalifa Ibn Hamad Al Thani, and called for their immediate and unconditional release. The authorities responded that a decision to deport the two men had been "taken in view of the breach of Qatari Visa Law No. 3 of 1963 by the named persons. This law authorizes the concerned authority in the country to effect immediate deportation of any foreigner who does not comply with it... no criminal charges were brought against them under Qatari criminal law."
