A man died in custody after being severely ill-treated. The government expelled an asylum-seeker who risked grave human rights violations if returned to Peru.
Tony Mutka died in custody on 20 July, diuing his transfer from Hall prison, near Stockholm, to a distant hospital psychiatric unit. Wearing only his underpants, handcuffed behind the back, and with his legs in chains, he was transported from the prison lying on the floor of a van. One of the guards allegedly stood on his neck or head and shoulders during transport. He died of suffocation. Three of the foiu members of the prison staff involved in the transfer were charged. The three were convicted of misconduct and fined. The Prosecutor, who had sought convictions for gross misconduct and prison sentences, lodged an appeal.
A Peruvian asylum-seeker, Monica Castillo Paez, was expelled in August. She had fled to Sweden in 1990, but was refused asylum there, despite fears that she would be at grave risk if returned to Peru.
Her brother had "disappeared" after detention and was presumed dead and his lawyer had been maimed by a letter-bomb. M6nica Castillo P^ez' cousin had been killed, allegedly by security forces, and she and her family had received threats from people thought to be acting with the support of the Peruvian security forces. The aircraft returning her to Peru made a scheduled stop in the Netherlands, where she was able to disembark and ask for asylum.
Amnesty International wrote to the government expressing concern about the death in custody of Tony Mutka. The organization urged the Swedish authorities not to forcibly return M6nica Castillo P^ez to Peru.
