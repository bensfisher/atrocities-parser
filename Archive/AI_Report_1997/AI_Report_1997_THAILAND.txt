In November, six suspected drug traffickers were shot dead in Suphan Buri province after they had given themselves up to the police. The police claimed to have fired in self-defence when attacked by the suspects, whose handcuffs had been removed so that they could indicate where weapons were hidden. After protests by human rights organizations and the victims' relatives, the Attorney General's office opened an investigation into the shootings.
Some 120 people under sentence of death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment in June, under a royal pardon to mark the 50th anniversary of the reign of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The Royal Pardon did not include people convicted of drugs offences. Over a thousand people held for "illegal immigration", including some 750 Myan-mar nationals, were released under the Royal Pardon, as was Surachai Sae Dan, a member of the Communist Party of Thailand, who had been convicted of murder and robbery in 1986.
