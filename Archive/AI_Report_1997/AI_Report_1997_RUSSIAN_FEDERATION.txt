Human rights violations by government forces took place in the context of the conflict in the Chechen Republic, including indiscriminate killings of civilians, detention without trial, torture and ill-treatment, and extrajudicial executions. At least 140 people were reported to have been judicially executed despite a promise to institute a moratorium. Between 500 and 600 prisoners were believed to be held on death row.

In January, Sergey Kovalyov resigned as Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights, followed by most other members of the Commission. In February, the Commission released its report on human rights in the Russian Federation for 1994 and 1995, which criticized government policies and practices. Later that month, the Russian Federation became a member of the Council of Europe and signed the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In May, a new Criminal Code was adopted by parliament, effective from January 1997.
In November, the UN Committee against Torture examined the second periodic report of the Russian Federation on implementation of the provisions of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Committee expressed
concerns about allegations of systematic and widespread torture and ill-treatment in Russia, including violations during the conflict in the Chechen Republic, and made extensive recommendations to remedy these violations.
In July, President Boris Yeltsin won a majority of votes in the second round of the presidential elections. In August, a peace agreement ended the hostilities in the armed conflict in the Chechen Republic.
There was still no law on a civilian alternative to military service, which placed all conscientious objectors imder the threat of imprisonment.
In December 1995, Vadim Hesse submitted his appeal to perform alternative civilian service to the Military Recruitment Office of Noginsk district, Moscow Region, He was arrested in January 1996 and charged with "evading the regular draft to active military service" under Article 80 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

In February, Aleksandr Nikitin, a retired Russian naval officer who had worked on a report on the dangers of nuclear waste in the Northern Fleet for the Norwegian non-govemmental group the Bellona Foundation, was arrested by the Federal Security Services in St Petersburg.

head of the Presidential Administration -but was not allowed to leave Omsk. Yury Shadrin appeared to have been arrested solely for his human rights activities as a public defender and for the peaceful expression of his conscientiously held beliefs. He was a prisoner of conscience.
There were numerous allegations of torture and ill-treatment in detention, both in criminal cases and in the context of the conflict in the Chechen Republic; most did not appear to receive prompt and impartial investigation. Ethnic minorities were particularly vulnerable. Sultan Kurbanov, a Chechen resident in Moscow, was arrested in January by two policemen who came to his apartment claiming he was wanted for questioning at police headquarters and would be released after two hours. Instead he was driven to a warehouse depot in the Kuntsevsky district of Moscow and beaten with truncheons and sticks by about 10 police officers who emerged from a bus parked nearby. He said he was hit repeatedly, including on his legs, head and face, by what he described as metal implements. Later that evening, a woman found Sultan Kurbanov lying "wounded and half dead" in a street in Kuntsevsky district. The local police refused to help her but they allowed her to telephone his family. He was then taken to Moscow City Hospital No. 1 by a relative, who claimed he overheard nurses saying there had been a directive from the head of the hospital that no one of Chechen origin was to receive medical treatment. The relative told them that Sultan Kmbanov was an Ossetian, and he received treatment.
The conditions in pre-trial prisons continued to amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In October, it was reported that 280 people died in pre-trial detention centres in Moscow dxuing the first nine months of the year.
Human rights violations carried out by government forces in the context of the armed conflict in the Chechen Republic included indiscriminate killings, detention without trial, torture and ill-treatment, and extrajudicial executions.
In early March, Russian forces bombarded the town of Semovodsk, without any apparent concern for the safety of the trapped civilian population, after claiming that armed Chechen groups had set up in the town. Between 10,000 and 16,000 people were believed to have fled Ser-
novodsk at this time, but some 7,000 civilians remained. Many of those who stayed in the town were people displaced by the conflict from elsewhere in the Chechen Republic. Hundreds were killed and injured by the Russian federal forces. During the attack, representatives of the Intemational Committee of the Red Cross were denied access to the town. Russian troops who entered Semovodsk were also reported to have carried out extrajudicial executions. One eye-witness stated that a young woman was arrested in the street by several soldiers and taken to a nearby house. Her dead body was later found there. Indiscriminate attacks by the Russian federal forces were also carried out in March, April and August against civilians in the Chechen villages of Samashki, Shali, Kom-somolskoye and the capital, Grozny.
There were numerous reports of torture and ill-treatment of civilians in the so-called "filtration points", detention camps set up by the Russian army during the conflict in the Chechen Republic. None of these reports was known to have been promptly or impartially investigated. In March, during the Russian military attack on Semovodsk, men between the ages of 16 and 55 were moved to "filtration points". All the men were believed to have been freed when the camps were closed down.
The Russian Federation made a formal commitment to suspend all executions, pending the full abolition of the death penalty within three years, when it acceded to the Council of Europe in February. Nevertheless, executions in Russia continued and no effective steps were taken to impose the moratorium on executions. In November, Anatoly Pristavkin, Chairman of the Presidential Clemency Commission, reported that 140 executions had been carried out during the year, 103 of them after Russia joined the Council of Europe. Ln September, Val√©ry Borschev, a member of parliament and representative of the Chamber of Human Rights under the President, referred to a study carried out in Russia which claimed that judicial errors had been made in 30 per cent of death penalty cases.
An estimated 500 to 600 prisoners remained on death row. A draft law on the moratorium on executions, prepared by two Duma deputies, was under discussion at the end of the year.

Reports indicated that legal provisions for refugees and asylum-seekers were inadequate. In March, Elgudzha Khutaye-vich Meskhia, an opponent of the Georgian Government, sought political asylum in Russia. He was arrested at the request of the Georgian Government and forcibly repatriated to Georgia, where he was at risk of torture and ill-treatment. In April, Rahim Qaziyev, the former Minister of Defence of Azerbaijan, was forcibly returned to that country, where he faced ill-treat-ment and the death penalty. In November, reports claimed that he was being kept in detention in Azerbaijan and had not been able to see his lawyers since August. His family had been allowed to see him only once since his return.
Forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, who was reportedly killed in April by the Russian army, were responsible for human rights abuses, including torture and ill-treatment, hostage-taking and deliberate and arbitrary killings. In January, an armed group of Chechens calling itself "Lone Wolf entered the southern Russian town of Kizlyar in Dagestan and took over the central hospital and adjoining maternity home. Civilians from apartment blocks surrounding the medical complex were forced into the hospital. The group's leader, Salman Raduyev, said the hostages would be shot if Russian troops did not withdraw from the Chechen Republic. At the same time, hostages were taken by armed Chechens at an electrical plant near Grozny. The hostages from Kizlyar were taken to the village of Pervomaiskoye. The Russian army launched heavy artillery and Grad-rocket attacks on the village in an apparently indiscriminate attack, without regard for the lives of the civilians in the village or the hostages themselves. The Russian army reportedly secured the freedom of 82 hostages from Pervomaiskoye; the remaining hostages were later freed by their Chechen captors.
