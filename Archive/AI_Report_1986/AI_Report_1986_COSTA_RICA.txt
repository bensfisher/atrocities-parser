Costa Rica
Four people remained in prison after being sentenced in 1983 and 1984 to long prison terms for acts which according to the govemment were carried out in 1981 by a terrorist group called La Familia. The prisoners continued to maintain that such a group never existed and that they were arrested and convicted because of their work with peasant and slum-dwellers' associations. Despite repeated appeals from Amnesty International and other organizations, the prisoners' assertions that they were ill-treated at the time of their arrest and during interrogation by the Organismo de Investigación Judicial (OIJ), the special police investigations unit of the judiciary, have apparently never been properly investigated. The prisoners also maintained that their trials fell short of internationally agreed standards and did not accord with Costa Rican legal procedures, pointing out, for example, that time limits on specific stages of the proceedings were breached. They maintained further that their treatment in prison was sub-standard.
Delays were also alleged in the cases of members of the Comité Patriótico Nacional (COPAN), National Patriotic Committee, of Alajuela, arrested in August 1984 during a demonstration. All had been released by the end of 1985 but charges, including that of illegal association, remained pending and trial dates had not yet been fixed.
In October Amnesty International telexed the Costa Rican President Luis Alberto Monge calling for the results of inquiries by Costa Rican agencies into the death of former Panamanian Vice-Minister of Health Dr Hugo Spadafora to be made public (see entry on Panama). His decapitated body had been found in Costa Rica in September.
