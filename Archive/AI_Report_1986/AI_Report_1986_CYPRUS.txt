Amnesty Intemational worked for the release of Jehovah's Witnesses imprisoned for refusing on conscientious grounds to perform military service and welcomed the release of all such prisoners as a result of a Supreme Court decKion.

call-up are considered to be deserters and can be sentenced to up to two years' imprisonment, with repeated terms of imprisonment for continued refosal. Police officers, priests and members of the Armenian Orthodox, Catholic and Maronite religions are, however, exempted. Amnesty International did not learn of any imprisoned conscientious objectors who were not Jehovah's Witnesses.
On 20 September the Supreme Court ruled that the composition of the Military Tribunal, which heard all cases of conscientious objection, did not conform to the Constitution and it ceased to function. As a result, all those sentenced by the Military Tribunal, including conscientious objectors, were released and Amnesty International knew of no imprisoned conscientious objectors at the end of 1985.
