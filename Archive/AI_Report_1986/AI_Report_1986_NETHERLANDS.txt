Dutch Government was asked to review the procedures followed in this case, to strengthen existing safeguards against involuntary return and to develop further safeguards, as necessary. The government in its reply of 14 May stated that at no time did the 45 Sri Lankan Tamils request asylum or express fears of persecution and that, in the government's view, the existing procedures contained sufficient safeguards for people requesting asylum. Amnesty Intemational continued to seek information on the incident.
