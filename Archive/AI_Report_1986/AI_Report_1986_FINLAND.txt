Amnesty International was concerned about the imprisonment of conscientious objectors for refusing to carry out unarmed military service. They were not offered alternative civilian service even though they were prepared to do it. Jorma Tapio Vihavainen, a 26-year-old dentist, went to prison on 6 August. He had been assigned to unarmed military service, but refused to report to barracks on the grounds that "all life is valuable and should not be destroyed". He was adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International and on 9 December was accepted for alternative civilian service. His release from prison was expected in January 1986. Tapio Olavi Puhakka, a 23-year-old student, was also assigned to unarmed military service and refused to obey. His sentence began on 2 December.
Following reports of a possible revision of the law on military service, Amnesty International wrote in January 1985 to the Prime Minister, Kalevi Sorsa, and the Ministers of Defence, Justice, Labour and Social Affairs, stating its position on conscientious objection. In April Amnesty International wrote to the chairman of the Parliamentary Defence Committee considering the new draft law. Amnesty International stated that the length of alternative service should not punish anyone for conscientiously held beliefe. Hie draft law increased the length of alternative civilian service from 12 to 16 months, compared to regular military service of eight months, which Amnesty International considered could be punitive. The new law incorporating this change was passed at the end of June, and was due to come into force in 1987. A new law was also passed in 1985 exempting Jehovah's Witnesses from military service with effect from 1987.
