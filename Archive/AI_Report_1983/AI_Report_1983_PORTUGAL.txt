Amnesty Intemational was concemed about the length of legal proceedings against alleged members of the Partido Revolucionário do Proletariado (PRP), Proletarian Revolutionary Party, some of whom had been in prison since June 1978. They were arrested in connection with bank robberies and bomb explosions allegedly carried out by PRP members.
In July 1982 the Constitutional Commission upheld the decision of the Supreme Court to annul the original convictions {sqq Amnesty International Report 1982). The principal accused - Isabel do Carmo and Carlos Antunes, who were never accused of being directly implicated in the robberies and explosions, and Fernanda Fraguas -were released into provisional liberty. The position with respect to a retrial was not known. Eleven alleged members of the PRP had announced their intention to appeal for a presidential amnesty.
