Burma
Amnesty International continued to face great difficulties in obtaining information about human rights violations in Burma. No information regarding human rights concerns or individual cases of imprisonment was divulged by the government.
Opposition political groups remained banned, and criticism of the government was not tolerated. Despite this, however, it was believed that few political prisoners were held after a widespread amnesty in 1980. Some members of the Burma Communist Party were reported to have been arrested during 1982 but names were not disclosed. Amnesty International was also concerned about the reported detention without charge or trial of 500 Chinese, some of whom were reported to have been held because of their support for the Cultural Revolution in China in 1967. Amnesty International was not able to confirm any of these reports.
A 1975 anti-subversion law gave wide discretionary powers to government security agencies. These security agencies were widely reported to have infringed judicial procedures and constitutional guarantees in their operations. Persistent reports suggested that the police and other security forces continued to use physical and psychological coercion, including torture, during interrogation in order to obtain confessions and information. These reports involved both criminal and political cases.
