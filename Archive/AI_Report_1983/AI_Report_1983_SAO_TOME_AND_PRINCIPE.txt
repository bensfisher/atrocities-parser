Sao Tome and Principe
Amnesty International was concerned by the continuing imprisonment of five people convicted in 1977 and 1979 after trials which did not meet internationally recognized standards. Three were adopted by Amnesty International as prisoners of conscience. There was also concern about the use of detention without trial.
Joaquim Matias da Silva Cruz and Agnelo Salvaterra were convicted in November 1977 by the Special Tribunal for Counter-Revolutionary Acts on charges of trying to overthrow the government, and sentenced to 16 and 17 years' imprisonment. They were adopted as prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International on the grounds

that they were convicted on the basis of false evidence because they were known critics of the government Agnelo Salvaterra was also convicted for advocating the secession of Principe in an article published in a Portuguese newspaper.
Another prisoner convicted by the Special Tribunal for Counter-Revolutionary Acts in March 1979 was also adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience. Albertino Neto, formerly the armed forces' commander, was arrested in February 1978 on his return from military training in Cuba. He was convicted on charges of plotting to kill the Head of State, but the only evidence against him was another defendant's statement which appeared to have been made under threat of execution and has since been withdrawn. The real reason for his imprisonment appears to have been that the authorities considered him to be too popular in the armed forces and to hold "liberal" political views.
Five detainees who were arrested in December 1981 after demonstrators on Principe had protested against shortages of supplies were released uncharged in mid-1982. Amnesty International was concerned that they were apparently detained because they had criticized government policies.
