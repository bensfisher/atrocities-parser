SWEDEN
Amnesty International adopted two Swedish conscientious objectors during 1975-76. Swedish law provides an alternative civilian service for conscientious objectors. The benefit of this concession is reduced by the fact that the civilian service is longer than the period of compulsory military service and because the alternative service is usually of such a nature as to contribute to the "total defence" of the country.
Of the two cases adopted by AI, Johan Mats Amvall has had his application for alternative service rejected three times. On each occasion he received a progressively heavier prison sentence of respectively one, 2 and 3 months. (The last sentence was reduced to 2 months.) Jonas K. Linderhorn has refused to apply for alternative service. He has recently been sentenced to 2 months after having served two previous terms of one and 2 months respectively.
