LESOTHO
Nineteen supporters of the opposition Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) received prison sentences ranging from 3 to 5 years on 11 July 1975 at the conclusion of Lesotho's second major treason trial within a year. Their convictions followed the conviction of 20 other BCP supporters at a trial in February 1975. The trial of the 19 arose from their involvement in an abortive attempt to overthrow the ruling National Party government of Chief Leabua Jonathan in January 1974.
Eleven other defendants were acquitted during the course of the trial. An Amnesty International observer, Professor Barend van Niekerk of the University of Natal in South Africa, attended in the early stages of the trial.
Subsequently, on 20 May 1976, the Lesotho Appeal Court quashed convictions on three of the defendants and reduced the sentences imposed on three others.
AI groups provided substantial relief assistance to the families of those imprisoned and to more than 100 other BCP supporters who had been detained without charge for the greater part of 1974. Thirty-seven prisoners are currently taken up as investigation cases.
Following the arrest of former BCP general secretary G. M. Kolisang on 21 November 1975, he was adopted by an AI group. Mr Kolisang was released uncharged on 21 January, after having been held for the maximum 60-day period
