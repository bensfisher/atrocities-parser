ITALY
Two new adoption cases were taken up by Amnesty International during the year, and AI groups continue to work for two prisoners adopted earlier. All are conscientious objectors (COs). The new cases were Dalmazzio Bertulessi, sentenced in December 1974 to 16 months' imprisonment, and Liborio Filippi, sentenced in January 1976 to one year's imprisonment. Dalmazzio Bertulessi was released in February 1976.
Although the Italian law on conscientious objection provides for sentences of between two and four years in a military prison for objectors who are not granted CO status, shorter sentences of between 12 and 16 months now seem to be the norm. It also appears that fewer applications for alternative service are rejected by the authorities than was previously the case.
The majority of conscientious objectors in Italy are Jehovah's Witnesses of whom an estimated 200 are currently in detention. There are in addition a few conscientious objectors who, for political reasons, reject both military and alternative civil service. AI has had difficulty in gaining information on individual cases of Jehovah's Witnesses and has usually taken up the cases only of those objecting to both forms of service on political grounds.
Conditions in military jails, some of which are in centuries-old buildings, continue to be a cause for concern. Dalmazzio Bertulessi and other COs went on a hunger strike in Gaeta Prison in August 1975 to protest against bad conditions. Their protest received wide publicity in the Italian press and parliament. Consequently the recent reform of the civil prison system has, in theory, now been extended to military prisons.
