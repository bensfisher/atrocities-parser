DOMINICA
Amnesty International continued to follow the case of Desmond Troiter, sentenced to death in 1974 after having been found guilty of the murder of an American tourist. On 22 March 1976 AI wrote to Sir Louis Cools-Lartigue, Governor of Dominica, to reiterate its appeal for a commutation of the death sentence.
Mr Trotter was reprieved on 3 April 1976 and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, following a retraction of her testimony by the chief prosecution witness. Mr Trotter has always maintained that he is innocent and that his political activities were the reason for his arrest and conviction.
AI has no adopted prisoners in Dominica.
