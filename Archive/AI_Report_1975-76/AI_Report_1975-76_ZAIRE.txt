During mid-1975 a number of individuals were arrested and accused of complicity in an abortive coup in June against the government of President Mobutu Sesé Seko. Four generals as well as other military personnel and civilians were among the total of about 40 who were detained. In August 1975 they were tried in camera by a military tribunal.
At the end of August and the beginning of September death sentences were passed by the tribunal on seven army officers. Twenty-six persons were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 6 months to 20 years, and sevèn were acquitted.
On 8 September 1975 Amnesty International cabled President Mobutu urging commutation of the death sentences. At the time of writing, they have not yet been carried out.
