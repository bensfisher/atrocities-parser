MAURITANIA
During June 1975 Amnesty International learned of the release on "provisional liberty" of 30 AI adoptees who had been held without trial since the previous year. In September 1975 this group benefited from a general amnesty which removed the restrictions that had been imposed upon them. As a result, case work on these former prisoners ceased, and AI has now no adoption or investigation cases in Mauritania.
