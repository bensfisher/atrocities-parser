PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF LAOS
In December 1975 a People's Democratic Republic of Laos was proclaimed. In January 1976, Amnesty International wrote to the new President of Laos, Prince Souphanouvong, and presented the organization's work to the government. AI expressed the hope that the new government would show clemency towards members of the administration and army belonging to the "Vientiane side" (generally described as "conservative" or "rightist") of the former coalition government. In September 1975, 31 leaders of the "conservative" administration, who had left the country before the trial, had been tried and condemned in absentia to sentences ranging from 20 years imprisonment to the death penalty for "treason, corruption and gross abuse of power".
Many prominent leaders and senior officials of the former Vientiane administration had fled the country during the months which saw the gradual collapse of the coalition government in spring 1975. The policy of the victorious Pathet Lao authorities towards military and civil officials of the former government does not seem to have taken forms of harsh repression in a majority of cases. Many have now to undergo some form of "reeducation". However, the length and nature of "re-education" does not seem to be clearly defined. According to one press report, of between 5,000 and 10,000 people who have been moved to "re-education centers" in the former Pathet Lao zone, only eight were known to have returned to their homes by March 1976.
