ECUADOR
In the past year, only one new case was taken up by Amnesty International in Ecuador. Dr Julio Cesar Trujillo Vasquez was detained in Quito on 1 May 1975 and accused of slandering the military government. Dr Trujillo Vasquez is the head of the Ecuadorian Conservative Party, as well as a member of the Latin American Parliament. He was not formally charged but was detained in Montalvo military garrison in Ecuador's Amazon region.
AI sent a cable to President Guillermo Rodriguez Lara on 19 June 1975 requesting information on the legal status of the prisoner and asking that procedural guarantees be respected. Dr Trujillo Vasquez was unconditionally released shortly afterwards.
Seven of the nine prisoners taken up by AI prior to the period covered by this report were released during the past year, while groups continue to work for the two remaining political prisoners known to be detained in Ecuador. No allegations of torture or maltreatment have been received.
