THAILAND
The influx of refugees into Thailand following the communist advances in Indochina in April 1975 numbered some 70,000 or more by April 1976. In August 1975, it was reported that many thousands of these refugees would face arrest if they failed to register with the Thai immigration authorities. Amnesty International wrote to former Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj on 18 August 1975 seeking assurance that the plight of the refugees would be considered fairly by the government.
