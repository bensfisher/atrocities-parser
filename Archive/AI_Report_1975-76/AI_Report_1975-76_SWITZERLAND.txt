mann, were sentenced in February 1975 to 16 and 14 months' imprisonment respectively. These sentences were heavier than the penalties which had previously been the norm. However, they were reduced on appeal to 8 and 7 months respectively. Jean-Claude Huguenin -Elie, the third case, received a 7-month sentence in May 1975.
There is no alternative civil service in Switzerland for conscientious objectors. Only those whose religious beliefs prevent them from bearing arms on military service may be permitted to do non-combatant work within the armed services. However, all persons are required to comply with the draft procedure. Failure to do so is punishable under the military penal code. In 1975 approximately 500 people served sentences of imprisonment for refusing all military service.
There is a strong movement in Switzerland to amend the law. There is a proposal to modify article 18 of the constitution and establish a civilian service for those unable to reconcile compulsory military duty with the exigencies of their beliefs or conscience. This proposal has been submitted to the consultation procedure usual for new laws and constitutional amendments. A final draft will have to be approved by parliament before the Swiss people vote on it.
