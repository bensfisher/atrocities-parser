BURMA
Rangoon University was again the scene of unrest in June 1975 only a few months after the university had re-opened following demonstrations at the funeral of United Nations Secretary General U Thant in December 1974. On 11 June, 213 students were reported to have been arrested, and the university was again closed.
According to reports in September 1975, military tribunals had sentenced those who had participated in the June riots to terms ranging from 10 to 14 years' imprisonment and several hundred students received sentences of between 4 and 7 years.
At the end of March 1976, 2,000 students demonstrated in Rangoon at the continued detention of some of their colleagues. A student leader, Tin Maung U, was arrested at this time and reports on 4 April said that a special tribunal had been held on his case. He was sentenced to death, having been convicted of plotting to assassinate state leaders and attempted rebellion.
