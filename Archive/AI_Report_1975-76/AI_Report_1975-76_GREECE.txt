GREECE
The only prisoners of conscience adopted by Amnesty International in Greece at the present time are 32 Jehovah's Witnesses who are imprisoned because of their refusal to perform military service. There is no provision in Greek law for conscientious objection to military service, and any Greek who refuses to be conscripted is liable to imprisonment. To AI's knowledge the only conscientious objectors are Jehovah's Witnesses. The average sentence passed on these prisoners is 4| years, which may be reduced on appeal.
All Jehovah's Witnesses receive remission of sentence for good behaviour. In addition, every day of work (if they are in a prison where they are able to work) counts for 2 days' imprisonment. The effects of these reductions in the prison time served are not, however, of great benefit to the prisoners, because as soon as they have finished serving one sentence they are liable to

re-arrest and re-imprisonment on the same charge. In theory repeated imprisonment is possible until the man concerned is past military age, which is 40 years. In many cases known to AI, prisoners are serving their third sentence.
In September 1975 Andrew Blane, a member of AI's International Executive Committee, had meetings in Athens with Panayotis Lambrias, Under Secretary to the Prime Minister and General Secretary of Press and Information, and with Minister of Justice Constanine Stephanakis. At both meetings the situation of conscientious objectors in Greece was discussed in great detail.
AI has followed closely the trials of those alleged to have tortured prisoners between 1967 and 1974, which have taken place in Greece over the past year. An AI report on the first major trial is in preparation. (See section on the Campaign for the Abolition of Torture.)
