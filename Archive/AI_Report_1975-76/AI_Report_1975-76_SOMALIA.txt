On 17 June 1975 Amnesty International wrote to Major General Mohammed Siyad Barre, President of the ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council of the Somali Democratic Republic, urging that a general amnesty be granted to mark the 15th anniversary of Somali independence on 1 July. No reply was received, and preparations were made by the Research Department for a mission to Somalia to discuss the human rights situation with the authorities.

However, in October 1975 a series of amnesties to mark the sixth anniversary of the Supreme Revolutionary Council's accession to power resulted in the confirmed liberation of all but three of AI's Somali adoption cases. On 6 October, President Siyad Barre announced the release of a group of Somali teachers who had been sentenced in April 1974 to prison terms ranging from 7 to 10 years for organizing and taking part in an illegal strike. This group comprised the majority of AI adoption cases.
On 18 October, a special amnesty freed 112 convicts, and two days later, President Siyad Barre issued a seven-point amnesty decree which, according to some reports, freed all political prisoners in Somalia. It also commuted death sentences to life imprisonment, life sentences to 30 years and sentences of up to 30 years to 7 years.
Among those released in the 20 October amnesty were former Somali prime minister and Al-investigation case Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, who was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment in October 1974, and three of his former cabinet colleagues, who were sentenced at the same time to prison terms ranging up to 20 years.
Following the amnesty, AI continued to plan the projected mission. However, in May 1976 AI received a reply from the Somali authorities indicating that it would not be possible for an AI mission to be received in Somalia "for the moment" due to the preoccupation of the government with the resettling of persons affected by the 1975 drought.
