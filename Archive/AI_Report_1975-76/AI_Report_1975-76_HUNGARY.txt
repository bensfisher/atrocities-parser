HUNGARY
Amnesty International groups are currently working on three cases in Hungary. These include the Roman Catholic priest, Father Odon Lenard, who was re-arrested after serving a long sentence for persevering in providing religious instruction to young people. Another Roman Catholic priest under adoption, Father Jozef Szigeti, was released on 9 July 1975. None of AI's prisoners was covered by the amnesty law of 4 April 1975.
