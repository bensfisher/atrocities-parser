OMAN
Following the receipt of material alleging that some named British officers serving in Oman had been involved in the torture of political prisoners, Amnesty International wrote on 5 November 1975 to the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Defence Roy Mason requesting that an inquiry be carried out to establish the validity or otherwise of the allegations. In his reply of 8 March 1976, Mr Mason stated that:
After careful examination in consultation with our Ambassador in Oman, we have concluded that there are no reports of any incidents involving the serving members of Her Majesty's Forces, for whom Her Majesty's Government is responsible, or indeed the British officers serving on contract, which might form the basis for an investigation.
The number of political prisoners in Oman is not known. The only prisoner for whom an AI group is working is Murad Abdul Wahab, who is thought to have been imprisoned in Oman following his deportation from Bahrain.
