GABON
In late June 1975, 16 persons who had been held without charge since 1972 were tried in the Gabonese capital, Libreville. Of the 16, nine were acquitted and freed into "provisional liberty". Three received 2-year prison terms and four were sentenced to 8 years in prison. Five Amnesty International investigation cases were amongst those receiving terms of imprisonment. All of the sentences passed at the trial were reduced by one year in a presidential clemency declared during August 1975.
An attempt by AI Deputy Secretary General Hans Ehrenstr^le to visit Gabon during July 1975 as a follow up to an AI campaign for a general amnesty in that country during the previous February was abortive. Mr Ehrenstrale was

admitted to Gabon, but expelled the next day without having been able to contact any of the authorities.
On 31 December 1975 President Omar Bongo announced an amnesty which freed all of the prisoners sentenced in July 1975 with the exception of one, whose release was expected to follow shortly.
