MALAGASY REPUBLIC
In March 1975 more than 300 persons, including former President Philibert Tsiranana, were brought to trial on charges of complicity in the assassination of Colonel Richard Ratsimandrava, the Malagasy head of state who was shot dead in the capital, Tananarive, on 11 February 1975. In May 1975, however, the government announced an amnesty for 270 of the 300 persons charged, in the interests of "strengthening national unity".
On 15 June Lieutenant Commander Didier Ratsiraka, was named the new head of state, and 10 days later the martial law imposed on the island six months earlier was lifted. Also in June, the special military court which had been hearing the cases of those allegedly involved in the assassination of Colonel Ratsimandrava acquitted all but three of the accused, including former President Tsiranana. The three convicted were sentenced to 5 years' hard labour and to fines.
An Amnesty International mission planned for the Malagasy Republic during 1975 was postponed indefinitely in January 1976, after the Research Department received information that President Ratsiraka had proclaimed a genera amnesty on 31 December 1975 covering all political infractions committed prior to 1 January 1975.
