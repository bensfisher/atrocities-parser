CYPRUS
During the past year Amnesty International has continued to press for an investigation into the whereabouts of nearly 3,000 Greek-Cypriots, missing since the events in the summer of 1974. Although many of those missing may have died during the fighting, there is evidence that some were taken prisoner and were alive after the cessation of hostilities.
In some cases the men were known to have been taken to the Turkish mainland.

On 1 August 1975 and 23 January 1976 the subject was again raised in letters to the Turkish embassy in London.
