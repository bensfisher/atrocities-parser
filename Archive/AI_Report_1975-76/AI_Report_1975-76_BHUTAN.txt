BHUTAN
According to information received by Amnesty International, 21 persons are still detained in Bhutan on charges connected with an alleged conspiracy to assassinate King Jigme Singye Wangchuk (see Annual Report 1974/1975). Death sentences on six have been commuted to life imprisonment. There have been serious allegations of torture and at least two persons are believed to have died as a result of maltreatment and lack of medical attention.
In September 1975 AI prepared a summary of information concerning the situation of those detained in Bhutan. Andrew Blane, AI's representative to the United Nations and a member of the International Executive Committee, met the Bhutanese ambassador to the United Nations on 17 March 1976. He presented the summary and asked that it be transmitted to his government for comment.
Unfortunately, there has been no official response from the Bhutanese authorities to an earlier representation made to the Bhutanese embassy in New Delhi in March 1975 by Mumtaz Soysal, a Turkish lawyer and member of the International Executive Committee.
