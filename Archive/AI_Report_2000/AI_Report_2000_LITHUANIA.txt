Death penalty
Lithuania abolished the death penalty in June when the parliament iSeimas) voted by an overwhelming majority to ratify Protocol N0.6, which provides for the abolition of the death penalty except in time of war or the imminent threat of war.
After the ruling of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania on 9 December 1998 that the death penalty was unconstitutional, Lithuania made rapid progress to abolition during peacetime. The Constitutional Court ruled that the death penalty violated the basic human rights to life and protection from cruelty which are enshrined in the country's Constitution. On 21 December 1998 the Se/'masvoted for new legislation which replaced the death sentence with life imprisonment. As a result, nine prisoners under sentence of death were given life sentences. In January 1999 Lithuania signed Protocol N0.6. On 22 June the Se/masvoted overwhelmingly in favour of ratification and for the abolition of the death penalty. On 8 July Lithuania officially ratified Protocol N0.6.
